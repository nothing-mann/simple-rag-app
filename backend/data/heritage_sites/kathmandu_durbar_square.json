    "description": "Kathmandu Durbar Square, also known as Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located about two kilometers from the thermal area, accessible within a 10 to 15 minutes drive depending on traffic. The square features a variety of temples, palaces, and towers, many of which were seriously damaged by the recent earthquake and are currently being restored. At the entrance, visitors can see the Busan Preserve and the Ornithol Palace. The area is also home to an open-air souvenir marketplace called Person Portable E-Square. The square provides access to several hotels and restaurants, making it a vibrant cultural hub. One of the notable structures is the Kumari Ghar, built in 1757 by King Jayaprakash Malla, which is the home of the Kumari, or living goddess, considered to be an incarnation of the goddess Taleju. The building is lavishly decorated with fine carvings reflecting Newar art, and the Kumari occasionally appears in the inner courtyard. Photography of the Kumari is strictly prohibited, but visitors are allowed to photograph the inner courtyard. Another significant structure is the Shiva Parvati Temple, built on three-step brick platforms and featuring a Shiva Linga inside. The temple was constructed by King Rama Bahadur Shah. The square also contains the partially destroyed King Pratap Malla's column, the Indra Put Temple, and the Vishnu Temple. The Kootenay Temple enshrines a mystic goddess of tantric origin and has restricted access. The Hanuman Dhoka Palace, named after Lord Hanuman, was built by King Pratap Malla in 1680. The Person Put Tower, once one of the tallest towers in Nepal, was built by King Prithvi Narayan Shah in the mid-18th century and is currently under renovation. The palace complex served as the Royal Nepalese residence until the 19th century and is a site of important ceremonies, including the coronation of the Nepalese monarch. Inside the royal complex, the Pancha Machi Hanuman Temple features a unique design of five circular roofs. The Jagannath Temple, built by Mains Ramallah, is the oldest structure in the Durbar Square, with an idol dating back to the 15th century. The square also houses the famous Smash Whare Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, and the Taleju Temple, built in the 15th century by King Mahindra Malla, which is considered one of the most sacred temples in Nepal. The temple is dedicated to the goddess Taleju Bhavani, the protective deity of Nepal and its former royal family. The temple stands 36.6 meters high and is open only once a year during the festival of Dashain, strictly for Hindus. Despite renovations, the temple remains a significant cultural and religious site."

    "description": "Kathmandu Durbar Square, located in the heart of the capital Kathmandu, is one of the world heritage sites. It is also known as Basantipur and Hanumandoka, and it's just about a 15-minute walk from Thamel, a place which is very well known among tourists. It is one of the three Durbar Squares in the capital, the others being Patan Durbar Square and Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Unlike the other two Durbar Squares, this one served as the home for the kings of Nepal. After the unification, a big palace was built within the area for the kings to live in, but as of now, it serves as a museum. Kathmandu Durbar Square is often known as a place where different kings ruled the country for generations. The area is also home to the living goddess, Kumari. The square features a very famous stone sculpture of a deity who coexists in both Hinduism and Buddhism, which has its own interesting history. The people living in this area are called Newars, an ethnic group of Nepal who have been living in the Kathmandu Valley before the unification of Nepal. They speak their own language among each other, but they also speak the national language, Nepali. This area hosts many interesting local festivals throughout the year, with Indra Jatra being one of the most well-known, lasting for a week straight. The temples and monuments are mostly made of wood, bricks, and adobe clay, and most of them date back to the 17th century. Being an open place in the middle of a busy city, it is considered a good place for locals to hang out. Most of the temples and monuments in this area date back to more than the 17th century. Unfortunately, all of the temples were partially or completely damaged during the earthquake in 2015. Most of the temples are either already rebuilt or still under construction. The devastating earthquake took out most of the temples and monuments, and Kathmandu Durbar Square was the worst in terms of damage. This is why most of the temples are still under construction even after five years from the earthquake, and they have to be made in exactly the same style as before. The Kumari Temple, also known as the living goddess of Kathmandu Durbar Square, is where the current Kumari resides. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, visitors are not allowed to go into the temple, but they can appreciate the artwork of the temple, which was built during the 18th century. Kumari is the incarnation of the fierce goddess Talaiju and is the family goddess of the Malla kings who ruled the valley before the unification in the 18th century. Even though the Mallas were defeated by the new king, the tradition of worshipping the Kumari continues to this day. Kumaris are often selected at a very young age for their purity, and the current one is just about 6 years old."
