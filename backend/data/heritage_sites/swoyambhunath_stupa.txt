Description:  
Swoyambhunath Stupa, also known as the Monkey Temple, is a significant religious site located atop a hill in the Kathmandu Valley. According to legend, in ancient times, Kathmandu was a large lake called NagDaha, which was surrounded by hills and mountains. The lake was considered sacred, attracting many sages and religious figures who came to bathe in its waters. The first Buddha, Vipasvi Buddha, visited this holy site on a full moon day in the month of Chaitra, where he threw a lotus seed into the lake, which transformed into a thousand-petaled lotus flower, emanating a self-perpetuating celestial light known as Swayambhu Jyoti. This attracted various gods and goddesses who came to worship the light. 

The Buddhist saint Manjushri later visited the site, accompanied by his wives and followers, and decided to make the lake habitable for all. He drained the lake, leading to the establishment of the city of Kathmandu. To protect the Swayambhu light, King Prachandadev constructed the Swayambhu chaitya, surrounded by five chapels enshrining the five Dhyani Buddhas: Akshabhya, Ratnasambhava, Vairochana, Amoghasiddhi, and Amitabh, representing the elements of air, earth, water, fire, and sky. 

The stupa features around 315 stone steps leading up to it, flanked by stone-carved lions, elephants, peacocks, horses, and Garudas, symbolizing the vehicles of the Dhyani Buddhas. At the top of the steps, a large gilt 'vajra' is believed to have been erected by King Pratap Malla. The white dome of the stupa represents the world, while the large pair of eyes on each side symbolizes a protective vision over humanity. The stupa's design also includes a sign resembling the Nepali number 1, conveying a message of unity. Swoyambhunath is not only a UNESCO World Heritage Site but also a vital center for Buddhist pilgrimage and cultural heritage in Nepal.
