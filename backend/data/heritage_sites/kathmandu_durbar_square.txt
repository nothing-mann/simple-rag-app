Description:  
Kathmandu Durbar Square, also known as Basantipur and Hanumandoka, is located in the heart of the capital city, Kathmandu. It is one of the three durbar squares in the capital, the others being Patan Durbar Square and Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Unlike the other two, Kathmandu Durbar Square served as the home for the kings of Nepal after the unification, with a significant palace built within the area for royal residence, which now functions as a museum. This square has been a historical site where different kings ruled for generations and is renowned for its rich cultural heritage. The area is predominantly inhabited by the Newar community, who have lived in the Kathmandu Valley since before the unification of Nepal. The square hosts numerous local festivals, with Indra Jatra being one of the most notable, celebrated for a week. The temples and monuments in the square, primarily constructed from wood, bricks, and adobe clay, date back to the 17th century. Unfortunately, many of these structures suffered extensive damage during the 2015 earthquake, making Kathmandu Durbar Square one of the worst-hit areas. While some temples have been rebuilt, others remain under construction, adhering to their original architectural styles. The Kumari Temple, dedicated to the living goddess, showcases exquisite artwork from the 18th century, although access has been restricted due to the pandemic. The tradition of worshipping the Kumari continues to this day, with the current goddess being just six years old.
