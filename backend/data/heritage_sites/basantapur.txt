Description:  
Kathmandu Durbar Square, located in the heart of the capital city Kathmandu, is one of the three Durbar Squares in the valley, alongside Patan Durbar Square and Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Also known as Basantipur and Hanumandoka, it is just a 15-minute walk from Thamel, a popular area among tourists. Unlike the other two Durbar Squares, Kathmandu Durbar Square served as the royal palace for the kings of Nepal after the unification, with a significant palace built within the area for the kings to reside. Today, it functions as a museum. The square is rich in history, having been the seat of power for various kings over generations. The area is predominantly inhabited by the Newar community, who are the ethnic group that has lived in the Kathmandu Valley since before the unification of Nepal. The square hosts numerous local festivals throughout the year, with Indra Jatra being one of the most well-known, lasting for a week. The temples and monuments in the square are primarily constructed from wood, bricks, and adobe clay, with most dating back to the 17th century. Unfortunately, many of these structures were severely damaged during the 2015 earthquake, making Kathmandu Durbar Square one of the hardest-hit areas. As a result, many temples are either under reconstruction or have been rebuilt, adhering to their original architectural styles. The Kumari Temple, which serves as the home of the living goddess, showcases exquisite artwork from the 18th century. Despite the pandemic restrictions preventing visitors from entering the temple, the cultural significance and historical value of Kathmandu Durbar Square continue to attract attention.
