Description:  
The Harti Azima Temple, located in the northwest corner of Soyu Mahya, is a two-story temple designed in the style of an umbrella, also known as Ratnapura Mah Yani. This temple is significant as it is believed to house treasures within the subterranean areas of the site. According to the Pchar Raka Sutra, the deity Harti is the consort of Pansa, a natural spirit who was the commander-in-chief of the Yaka army under the legendary figure Vishar Raavana. Harti Azima is depicted as a powerful figure within the Yaka community, often shown in a seated posture, symbolizing her strength and dominance. She is regarded as a protector of children, especially those under the age of twelve, and is associated with various names such as Harti Mahak, Harti Mazu, and others. 

Legends narrate that Harti Azima had many children, but to feed her own, she would abduct and kill the children of others, causing immense grief in the Kathmandu Valley. The situation escalated to the point where the bereaved parents prayed to the Buddha for intervention. In response, the Buddha revealed to Harti Azima the pain her actions caused to others, leading her to repent and vow to protect all children instead of harming them. This transformation granted her the ability to withstand black magic and heal the sick, solidifying her role as a revered deity in the Kathmandu Valley. 

Historically, Harti Azima was often invoked during outbreaks of deadly diseases, and her image faced desecration during the reign of King RAB Bahadur Saha in the late 18th century, particularly after the death of his beloved queen from smallpox. The king's erratic actions led to the destruction of her statue, which was later restored as an act of penance. The temple remains a site of worship, where rituals are performed in her honor, reflecting her enduring significance in the cultural and spiritual life of the Kathmandu Valley.
