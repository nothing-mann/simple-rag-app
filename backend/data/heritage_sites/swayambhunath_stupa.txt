Description:  
Swayambhunath Stupa is an ancient religious architecture situated atop a hill in the Kathmandu Valley. According to the Swayambhu Purana, the entire valley was once an enormous lake, from which a lotus emerged, leading to the valley being known as Swayambhu, meaning "self-created." It is considered one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Buddhists and is also revered by Hindus. The complex consists of a stupa, shrines, and temples, some of which date back to the Licchavi period. The stupa features Buddha's eyes and eyebrows painted on it, symbolically looking in all four directions. Swayambhunath was founded by King Manadeva around the beginning of the fifth century CE. A damaged stone inscription at the site indicates work done in 640 CE. It is believed that the site was visited by the Indian emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE, who developed a temple on the hill that was later destroyed. Devotees circle the stupa, paying their respects while spending time in prayer. The site is also known for its resident monkeys, which are considered holy as they are believed to be the head lice of Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of wisdom and learning. Devotees often give food to the monkeys. The Swayambhunath complex suffered damage in the April 2015 earthquake, but the stupa was renovated in 2010, with its dome regilded using 20 kilograms of gold. The area also features shops selling various Nepali traditional artifacts and souvenirs. Additionally, Swayambhunath is a famous viewpoint offering stunning views of the Kathmandu Valley.
