Description:  
Kathmandu Durbar Square, also known as Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square, is located approximately two kilometers from the Thamel area and is accessible via a 10 to 15-minute drive, depending on traffic. The square is filled with an array of temples, palaces, and towers, showcasing stunning architecture, although some structures have been severely damaged by recent earthquakes and are currently undergoing restoration. The entrance to the square is through the Pashupati Gate, and the entrance fees contribute to the maintenance and rebuilding of the area. 

Among the notable structures is the Kumari Ghar, built in 1757 by King Jayaprakash Malla, which serves as the residence of the Kumari, a living goddess believed to be an incarnation of the goddess Taleju. The building is adorned with intricate carvings and features a three-story design, with the Kumari occasionally appearing in her inner courtyard. 

Another significant structure is the Shiva Parvati Temple, constructed on three stepped brick platforms, housing a Shiva Linga and wooden figures of Mahadev and Parvati. The temple was built by King Ram Bahadur Shah. 

The square also features the Hanuman Dhoka Palace, named after Lord Hanuman, who is regarded as the protector of the square. The palace complex includes the Pancha Machi Hanuman Temple, known for its unique five circular roofs, and was the royal residence until the 19th century. 

Additionally, the Jagannath Temple, built by King Pratap Malla, is the oldest structure in the square, while the Taleju Temple, dedicated to the goddess Taleju Bhavani, stands as one of the most sacred temples in Nepal. The temple is open only once a year during the festival of Dashain and is strictly for Hindus. 

Kathmandu Durbar Square is a vibrant hub of culture and history, offering visitors a glimpse into Nepal's rich heritage through its remarkable architecture and historical significance.
