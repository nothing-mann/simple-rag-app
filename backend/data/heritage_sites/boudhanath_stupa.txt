Description:  
Boudhanath Stupa, located about 5 kilometers from Kathmandu, is a monumental structure steeped in history and spirituality. Its origin and construction during the Licchavi period remain shrouded in mystery, with little concrete evidence regarding the specific individuals involved. According to legend, the creation of the Earth is attributed to a woman named Sukun or Kaa, who was once a celestial being punished for stealing flowers from Indra's garden. She was reborn as the daughter of an ordinary farmer in the Kandu Valley and sought to build a Buddhist temple, despite societal objections due to her low caste. The king granted her the necessary land for her religious endeavors, but she passed away before the completion of the stupa. Her four sons took on the task of completing the construction, which reportedly took 2,555 days. 

Initially, Boudhanath Stupa may have been constructed slightly elevated from the ground, similar to other stupas in the region. Over time, the stupa has evolved into its current form through successive rounds of construction and additions. The central feature of the stupa is its dome, adorned with 13 tiers resembling a pyramid-like structure, symbolizing the 13 heavens in Buddhist cosmology. The golden spire at the top holds great significance, while the western eye depicted as a semi-sleeping divine eye represents compassion and wisdom in the Buddhist tradition.

Buddhists revere the stupa as a sacred lotus flower, characterized by the white-painted lower dome and the yellow upper portion. Encircling the base of the dome are 108 small shrines housing different Buddha statues. At ground level, there are 147 prayer wheels lining the perimeter, where pilgrims chant the mantra "Om Mani Padme Hum" as they walk around the stupa, enhancing their spiritual devotion. Surrounding Boudhanath Stupa are four meditating Buddha statues, and near the entrance, a small shrine houses a silver chasminimi shrine along with a large lamp. The shrine's mud wall features depictions of the Buddha's biography, although they may be obscured by the smoke from the lamp.

The area also contains Buddhist and Hindu prayer beads, symbolizing the harmony and tolerance between these two religions. The stupa's base is constructed in a 16-corner mandala orientation, aligned from east-west to north-south, situated amidst residential houses, exemplifying the coexistence of religious sites and residential areas. Historical records from the Gopal genealogy indicate that the stupa was originally built during the Licchavi period and underwent restoration and repairs under various kings, including King Siddhi Narsingh Malla in the 6th century and King Pratap Malla in the 17th century.

Once a hub for traders, the surrounding area was known for its Nar community, who crafted and sold gold and silver ornaments to Tibetan pilgrims. Today, the trade has shifted towards goods catering to tourists. During Losar, a significant festival for Buddhist pilgrims, devotees traditionally made pilgrimages and engaged in commerce here. Following the cultural upheaval in China in 1959, numerous Tibetan refugees settled in the area, altering the trade dynamics towards Chinese goods.

Buddhist pilgrims established monasteries aligned with their respective traditions, such as Nupa, Sakyapa, Kupa, and Gupa, where they studied and taught Buddhism. During Losar, the stupa is adorned with colorful flags, reflecting the cultural influence of the northern region refugees. Local lamas exhibit a distinctive way of walking not commonly seen among other pilgrims in the Kathmandu Valley. Presently, a Chinese lama, representing the Tibetan Lama tradition, recites prayers often inherited from father to son, under the supervision of other lamas.

Visitors can explore the area, witnessing the Himalayas and engaging with the monasteries to learn about the daily life, culture, and traditions of the Buddhist community surrounding Boudhanath Stupa. Each monastery features a layout and decoration similar to others, predominantly using golden hues with varied colors on the ceiling. According to Buddhist practice, worship rooms are meticulously maintained, welcoming visitors at any time, although experiencing the true ambiance often requires participation in daily worship rituals.

After Nepal signed the World Heritage Convention in 1978, facilitated by UNESCO to support the repair and preservation of palaces, temples, and shrines, seven significant sites in the Kathmandu Valley were inscribed on the World Heritage list in 1979. UNESCO has urged international organizations to aid in safeguarding these heritages, and support has been received from various countries, including Boudhanath Stupa, which is among the seven designated monuments.

However, the proliferation of tall buildings near the stupa has indirectly impacted Boudhanath Stupa and its surrounding environment. Non-compliance with standards set by the Department of Archaeology poses challenges, including environmentally unfriendly window designs, excessive use of grills instead of wood, cement structures replacing traditional roofing materials, and deviations from approved height limits. Despite these challenges, Boudhanath Stupa continues to serve as a vital spiritual and cultural hub in Kathmandu, drawing pilgrims, tourists, and Buddhist practitioners from across the globe.

Monument name:  
Boudhanath Stupa  
...................................  
Fun fact:  
Boudhanath Stupa is the largest stupa in Nepal and one of the holiest Tibetan Buddhist temples outside of Tibet.  
.....................  
Description:  
Boudhanath Stupa, located in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu, stands as a ginormous white dome towering over visitors with its unblinking eyes, symbolizing peace and serenity. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is shaped like a pagoda mandala, representing a cosmological map to enlightenment or Bodhi. Inside the temple, every element represents aspects of life and the path to enlightenment. The triangular shape at the top of the tower symbolizes fire, while the gilded canopy represents air. The tower is topped by a pyramid with three steps, signifying a ladder to enlightenment. Hundreds of prayer flags are tied to the stupa, fluttering in the wind and carrying mantras from the earth to the heavens. Visitors and devotees can be seen circumambulating the dome and spinning prayer wheels, which have mantras inscribed on them. At the core of each wheel is a life tree, typically made of wood or metal. The concept of the prayer wheel embodies the turning of the wheel of Dharma, allowing those who cannot read or understand mantras to still participate in the spiritual practice. Spinning the wheels is believed to yield the same benefits as chanting the mantras. The atmosphere within the mandala evokes a profound sense of calmness and divinity, whether one is engaged in spinning the wheels or observing the prayer flags fluttering in the wind, carrying prayers to the heavens.
