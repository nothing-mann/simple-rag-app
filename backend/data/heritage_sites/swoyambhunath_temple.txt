Description:  
In ancient times, Kathmandu was in the form of a big lake known as NagDaha, which was renowned as the Kingdom of snakes. The lake was surrounded on all sides by hills and mountains and was considered a holy place where many sages and religious people would come to bathe. During the Golden Age, Vipasvi Buddha (known as the first Buddha) came to this place on the full moon day of the month Chaitra to take a bath. After bathing, he threw a lotus seed into the middle of the lake, which transformed into a lotus flower with a thousand petals. A self-perpetuating celestial light appeared in the lotus flower, attracting the attention of gods and goddesses, including Brahma, Vishnu, Mahadev, Vayudev, Agnidev, Indra, Laxmi, and Saraswati, who came to worship the light, honoring it as Aadi Buddha. 

The information about this light reached the Buddhist saint, Manjushri Boddhisattva, who, along with his two wives, Keshini and Upakeshini, and some of his consorts, came to worship the light. Upon seeing the celestial light, Keshini remarked on the beauty of the lake, and they felt as if they were in paradise. Manjushri declared the luminous light as the "Swayambhu Jyoti," the self-appearing light of Aadi Buddha, and expressed the desire to make the lake habitable and accessible to all.

Manjushri held a sword called Chandrahasa in his right hand and a book called Prajna Paramita Sutra in his left hand as he walked around the lake with his students. They established goddess Varada in Phulchowk and goddess Mokshada in Dhyanocho, then went to the lower hills of Chovar, where they erected an idol of Ganesh and worshipped him. Manjushri prayed for blessings and cleft the hill with his khadga, causing the water to rush out and drain the lake, making the valley habitable and allowing Swayambhu to be accessible to all. 

A new city, now known as Kathmandu, was settled, and Dharmakar was appointed as the king of this city. To protect and preserve the Swayambhu light, King Prachandadev later made the Swayambhu chaitya, covering the Swayambhu Jyoti. Five chapels were established around the Swayambhu chaitya, enshrining the five Dhyani Buddhas: Akshabhya, Ratnasambhava, Vairochana, Amoghasiddhi, and Amitabh, representing air, earth, water, fire, and sky. 

The Swoyambhu stupa also features four taras: Lochani, Marnaki, Pandura, and Aryatara. There are about 315 stone steps leading to the Swayambhu stupa, flanked by stone-carved lions, elephants, peacocks, horses, and Garudas, which represent the vehicles of the five Dhyani Buddhas. At the end of the steps, there is a large gilt 'vajra,' believed to have been erected by King Pratap Malla. 

The white dome of the stupa represents the world, while the large pair of eyes on each of the four sides symbolizes a pervasive vision that protects mankind from destruction. The sign of interrogation between these eyes resembles the Nepali number 1, conveying a message of unity in the world.
