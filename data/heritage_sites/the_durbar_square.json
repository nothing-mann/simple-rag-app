  "description": "The Durbar Square is one of the seven monument zones that make up the Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site. It consists of three Durbar Squares: Hanuman Dhoka, Patan, and Bhaktapur. Hanuman Dhoka is the heart of old Kathmandu, where kings used to live and were crowned. It features notable structures like the Taleju temple, which is over 35 meters high, the Kasthamandap, an ancient rest house built from a single tree, and other historic buildings. Patan Durbar Square is known for its rich history and well-preserved architecture, including the Kwa Baha Golden Temple and the Krishna Mandir with its intricate stone carvings. Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the smallest of the three, was the capital of the Malla Kingdom until the 15th century and showcases the Newari lifestyle from centuries ago. It includes notable sites like the Nyatapola temple and the Dattatreya Square.",
