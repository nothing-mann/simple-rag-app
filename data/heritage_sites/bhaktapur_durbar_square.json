    "description": "Bhaktapur is one of the three major cities of Kathmandu Valley. In the vernacular language of Kathmandu Valley the place is known as Khopade and Khopadesa. In the inscription issued jointly by Shivadeva and Amsuvarma of Sambat 516(594A.D.) the people are addressed to as the inhabitants of Khopring drang, which shows that the name of the place as Khopring drang and this inscription is located at Golmadhi Tole in present Bhaktapur. The historians have narrated the word Drang as village, and tala as developed settlement with market area. Therefore, there must have been many villages and settlements in and around the then Kathmandu Valley. The history from 9th to 12th century goes almost blank in Bhaktapur. The oldest inscription Gopal Raj Vamsavali and other chronicles credit Anand Deva as the founder of Bhaktapur city in 267N.S. (1197A.D.) and also mention that he had built a royal palace called Tripura. The royal palace of Bhaktapur city is located almost at the center of the city. Most of the monuments located in and around Bhaktapur Durbar Square were constructed during seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. During early medieval period, the palatial location was called with different names such as Tripura Palace, Thanthu Rajkula, and Vasantpur Palace. Like other royal palaces of the Kathmandu Valley, Bhaktapur Durbar Square is also built with many courtyards, royal buildings, stone spouts and temples dedicated to different Gods and Goddesses and an example of high architectural buildings erected during different centuries by different kings. The Durbar Square, as in the medieval period, did not serve only as the royal residence but also as an administrative center as well. Mul courtyard, the main courtyard of the Durbar Square is the oldest part still surviving. The courtyard was made in 1324A.D. Therefore, in order to write the history of this Durbar, we must peep into the contemporary political situation of the valley. In 1428 A.D. King Yakshya Malla came into power in Bhaktapur and enlarged his country and encircled Bhaktapur city with moats and defense walls pierced with defense gates. Although there is no evidence of the construction of a Durbar by him, it is often mentioned by the historians that the famous Tripura Palace was erected during his reign. He is also credited as the founder of Yaksheswar temple now standing in the palace complex. After the death of Yakshya Malla, in 1482, his son Raya Malla ascended the throne of Bhaktapur. But he was a very gentle king; his gentleness was exploited by his second brother Ratna Malla and broke the country into two. Then he started to rule from Kantipur as an independent king from 1484AD. In this way the greater Nepal valley having capital as Bhaktapur divided into two independent states-Bhaktapur and Kantipur. After that many kings like Pran Malla, Vishva Malla, and King Jagajyoti Malla ruled from Bhaktapur Palace but no significant evidences left about their contributions in Bhaktapur Palace. King Naresh Malla did some renovation work in the Taleju temple and added a couple of windows of sandalwood in Mul courtyard in 1637 AD. King Jagat Prakash Malla, who ascended the throne of Bhaktapur in 1644 A.D made a palace known as Vasantpur but unfortunately it is not known how the architecture of this building was. No documents give any information about its architectural form. He also extended Taleju Temple and established a temple dedicated to Bhavani Shankar near the western entrance of the Royal Palace, along with a Mandap in the precinct of main courtyard. Jitamitra Malla became the king of Bhaktapur in 1672 A.D. his reign was very important from the art and architectural point of view. There was some sort of competition in constructing and decorating the royal palace complexes among the contemporary kings in the valley. An inscription in 1678 A.D. states that he constructed the royal palaces called Thanathu Palace with stone spouts, gardens, and courtyard. Also, he restored Kumari courtyard and established the images of Goddess Astamatrikas and gilded the roof of Taleju. He established the tympanum and offered the big bell to the Goddess Taleju. King Bhupatindra Malla succeeded Jitamitra Malla in 1696 A.D. and built the building of the grand palace with ninety-nine courtyards and fifty-five windows. At present, we can see only fifty-five window palace and a few remaining courtyards among the ninety-nine courtyards. Only half a dozen of courtyards are exciting such as Mul courtyard, Bhairav courtyard, Ita courtyard, Malati courtyard, Siddhi courtyard and Kumari courtyard. King Bhupatindra Malla constructed the Malati courtyard and established a golden spout. Also the Taleju temple was embellished with golden pinnacles after restoration of it. The 55 windows palace was built in 1700 AD. Among the brick walls in their gracious setting and sculptural design, is a balcony of 55 windows. This balcony is a masterpiece of woodcarving. The rare example of King Bhupatindra Malla’s contribution is the Fresco paintings in the fifty-five windows palace. These paintings are the depiction of different stories as narrated in Ramayana and Mahabharat. The central figure of the painting is of God Viahvaroopa. This is one of the rare wall paintings of Nepal. The stone images of God NaraSingha, Hanuman and golden statue of his own are other examples of his contribution. In architectural field, in addition to the palace, another remarkable contribution is the Nyatapol Temple erected in 1702 AD adjacent to the palace in place Taumadhi. This towering five-storied pagoda stands on a five-terraced platform. This is the tallest pagoda in Nepal and is also the landmark of the country that has been proved to be one of the greatest attractions. Another contribution is the temple of Bhairavnath just few meters away from the Nyatapol which was built a decade after the inauguration of Nyatapol. This temple was first built as a one-storey pagoda but was later changed into a three-storied temple in 1718 AD by King Bhupatindra Malla. The temple is noted for its artistic grandeur. It is dedicated to Lord Bhairab- the god of terror. After Bhupatindra Malla, his son Ranajit Malla ascended the throne in 1722 AD. He was the last king of Bhaktapur. His contribution in the Durbar Square is the Golden Gate. It was built in 1753/54 that has been praised by the international art critics as the jewel of all the art works created in Asia during that period. This gate is embellished with deities and monsters with marvelous intricacy. Dattatraya Temple built in 1427 AD, which is built from the trunk of a single tree. Near this temple there is a monastery with exquisitely carved peacock windows. The square where this temple lies takes the name from this temple and known as Dattatraya Square. The square is famous for ornate Monasteries. The National Wood-working Museum and the Brass and Bronze are also housed here. The Government of Nepal has declared it a Protected Monument Zone and the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO has inscribed it into its world heritage list as a part of Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site in the year 1979.

    "description": "Bhaktapur Durbar Square is a plaza in front of the royal palace of the old Bhaktapur Kingdom. It is one of three Durbar Squares in the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Bhaktapur Durbar Square was listed in 1979 and is located in the current town of Bhaktapur, also known as Bhadgaon, which lies 13 km east of Kathmandu. It was the capital of the Malla Kingdom until the 15th century. It feels like time has stopped on its squares: the durbar square, the Taumadi with its two main temples, the Nyatapola and the Kasi Biswanath. There is also the Dattatreya Square on the other end. In Bhaktapur, you can still see how the Newars lived hundreds of years ago. It’s really great! You also don’t see much of the damages from the big earthquake in 1934 (1990 BS). They have restored almost everything, even the 55-windows palace. The carvings on the wooden windows are amazing. Look how the golden gate sparkles in the sun. This must be the entrance to the palace. Yes it is. But you should also visit the Naytapola temple, the five-storied building over there. It was built by King Bhupatindra Malla. The king himself carried bricks for its construction. Have you taken photos of the Dattatreya Square, with the famous Dattatreya temple and the peacock window at the eastern wing of the Pujari Math? It is the largest and most famous religious institution in Bhaktapur. A masterpiece in wood! Yes, of course I have. Bhaktapur really has great wood and metal work. More importantly, you can really see the history of its people. It is so much better than a museum with the temples, the streets and the squares full of life.",
