    "description": "Positioned at the northern end of Patan Darbar Square, this three-tiered temple is situated on a singular rectangular plinth, its broader side facing east, serving as the principal façade. The main entrance is guarded by two stone lions, while a three-bayed colonnaded opening and a door are found on the wall facing west. A small room at the northeast corner is accessible from both inside and the front, and a single-run stone staircase on the southern wall ascends towards the sanctum where the main statue of Bhīmasena, depicting him killing Duḥśāsana, is installed. Nearby, statues of a yellow Draupadī, a blue Bhairava, and a red Kālī can be found. The first floor also houses a secret room. The first floor's principal façade features a projecting canted bay window, clad in gilt copper and adorned with intricate carvings. Artistically crafted struts display carvings of various deities, supporting the broad overhanging roofs. The two lower roofs are covered with jhĩgaṭī tiles, while the top roof is covered with brass sheets, a later addition as indicated in a photograph by Bourne & Shepherd, taken around 1870 CE. Gilt pinnacles on each front roof, attached to the main core wall, culminate in the topmost pinnacle at the temple's highest ridge, highlighted by a crowning umbrella. Two metal banners (patāḥ) hang down from the central pinnacle. Bhīmasena, known as Bhindyaḥ in the local language, is a revered figure in Hindu mythology and is worshipped as the god of trade in Newar society. The temple is regarded as one of the eight jewels of the Patan Darbar Square. Lalitpur houses four main Bhīmasena temples: Juju Bhindyaḥ (the King's Bhīmasena) in Mangalbazar, Puṃ Bhindyaḥ (the artists' Bhīmasena) in Sundhara, Dhvākhā Bhindyaḥ (a Bhīmasena placed near a door) in Chāḥbahāla, and Kumhāḥ Bhindyaḥ (a Bhīmasena established by potters) in Cyāsal. Although no historical document records the initial construction, the monument was once a rest-house (capāḥ ot dharmaśālā) known as Balaṣūni Capāḍa. The Kīrtipatākā (in vers 79-80), a poem composed by Kunu Śarmā in 1652 CE (NS 772), mentions this building and explains that the merchants became prosperous thanks to Bhīmasena, who killed Kīcaka and defeated Kauravas in the Mahābhārata war. The post colophon of Dānaratnākara reveals that the building initially had only one storey. In 1627 CE (NS 747), during the reign of King Siddhinarasiṃha Malla, a certain Hari Bhāro renovated the capāḥ as a one-story building. A stone stele inscription confirms that in 1681 CE (NS 801), King Śrīnivāsa Malla reconstructed it into its present temple form by adding two additional stories. (Regmi 1960, 287). To the south of the entrance, a bell donated in 1697 CE (NS 817) can be found and another bell, donated in 1697 CE (NS 817), hangs to the north of the entrance. The temple's roofs are supported by struts adorned with images of Bhairava, Gaṇeśa, Bhīmasena, and other gods, donated between 1682-1683 CE (NS 802-803). Remnants of the original clay statue of Bhīmasena can be found on the second floor. In 1701 CE King Yoganarendra Malla replaced the clay statue of Bhīmasena with one made of bronze and initiated the Bhīmasena procession tradition. Legend has it that Kalyāṇa Siṃha of Naudvã Bāhāḥ fashioned the statue in the likeness of the fierce visage of Yoganarendra Malla. Surviving the 1934 CE earthquake, the temple suffered substantial damage during the earthquakes of 2015. The stone pillar, which supported a gilt metal lion, crumbled, and the upper stone shaft fractured into two pieces. Between 2015 and 2016, a team from the University of Applied Arts, Vienna, meticulously executed the restoration of both the pillar and the lion statue. Between 2019 and 2022 CE, the upper two tiers of the temple underwent dismantling and reconstruction under the technical guidance of the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust. During this period, a small replica of the Bhīmasena statue was installed on the ground floor to ensure uninterrupted worship.",

The pūjā begins in the early morning and devotees flock to the temple for it. A secret room in the temple contains a special statue of Bhīmasena that is taken out and exhibited only on this occasion. 3.
