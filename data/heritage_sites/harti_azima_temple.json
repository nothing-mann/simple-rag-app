  "description": "The story of Harti Azima and Soyu in the northwest corner of Soyu Mahya there is a two-story temple in the style of an umbrella. This Temple is also called Ratnapura Mah Yani takes care of the treasures inside the suu underground according to Pchar Raka Sutra. The dii Harti is the concert of Pansa or Natural Spirit according to the Mahavamsa. Pansa was the commander-in-chief of the Yaka Army of Vishar Raavana and had another 27 Yaka generals under his orders. It is said that the Dy Harti had 500 children. The name of her 500 children is unknown but in modern days her five children are known to people. She carries Danab Bazu on her back, Danmesu on her left hand, Wasi Bazu on her right lap, Wasi Meu on her left lap, and Gilam Bazu just stays beside her right leg. It seems that these five representatives are also present at all the temples and statues of Mah Yaki Harti Aima. She is considered to be one of the most powerful and strong of the demons and has established her dominance over the country. She is depicted in seating postures and seems to be very powerful within the Yaka Community. She is regarded as the protector of the children as well as Swur region regarded as Takini. It is believed she visits different places and takes care of children under 12 years of age. Harti Mahak is also known as Harti Mazu, Oim Mazu, B Yoga, Mauu Dali, Tak Maasi, etc. According to legends, Hari Azima had many of her children of her own whom she loved and cared but to feed the hungry children of her own she used to abduct and kill the children of others. She used to go to human settlements and Kathmandu Valley every night kidnapping other children for me and causing grief to the people of Kathmandu Valley. The bereaved parents of Kathmandu Valley pleaded to the Buddha to save them. One day Sakyamuni Siddhartha Gautam Buddha, hearing the prayer, he Ananda, the beloved daughter of Harti Mahay Yakini in the Pinda Patra. After losing her beloved daughter Ananda, Harti Mahay Yakini wandered around looking for her. Harti Mahay Yakini walked around wandering in sorrow and weeping. The Buddha then revealed that he was the kidnapper. Buddha pointed out that her own pain at the loss of her only one child of her many children was nothing compared to the loss endured by the parents of her victims, many of whom had lost their only child. The Buddha pointed out that she was suffering because she lost one of her 100 children and asked if she could imagine the suffering of parents whose only child had been devoured. She replied that their suffering must be many times greater than hers. The Buddha explained to her that the children are so dear to every parent so it would be unwise to cause suffering to people by devouring their children. Buddha made her realize how others felt when she kidnapped, killed, and ate other children. Realizing that she had done grievous wrong, Hari repented and committed herself to protecting all children. Seeing condition, the Buddha then returned Ananda to her mother. This incident opened the eye of Harim Mahay Yakshini and she decided to give up the habit of eating meat by violence. Henceforth she refrained from killing children and any sentinel banks whatsoever and became a protector of them. Harti Azima became the protector of children and women and childbirth. In exchange, the Buddha gave her Bodi which enabled her to withstand black magic and evil powers and gave her the power to cure the sick. It is believed that Harti Azima protects one's child since it is in a womb as a fetus. She is also called the second living goddess and it is believed that she possesses a human's body and heals the people in the form of Dima. Lots of rituals are performed in front of Hari Aima as she has been worshiped as a highly respected deity by the natives of Kathmandu Valley. Historically, Har Azima was often called upon by smallpox victims of particularly deadly diseases that frequently flare in the Kathmandu Valley. Harti Azima was often the only hope of the Kings and commoners alike.",
