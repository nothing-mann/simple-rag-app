  "description": "The story of Harti Azima and Soyu in the northwest corner of Soyu Mahya, there is a two-story temple in the style of an umbrella. This temple is also called Ratnapura Mah Yani, which takes care of the treasures inside the suu underground. According to Pchar Raka Sutra, the deity Harti is the consort of Pansa or Natural Spirit. According to the Mahavamsa, Pansa was the commander-in-chief of the Yaka Army of Vishar Raavana and had another 27 Yaka generals under his orders. It is said that the deity Harti had 500 children; the names of her 500 children are unknown, but in modern days her five children are known to people. She carries Danab Bazu on her back, Dan Mesu on her left hand, Wasi Bazu on her right lap, Wasi Meu on her left lap, and Gilam Bazu just stays beside her right leg. It seems that these five representatives are also present at all the temples and statues of Mah Yaki Harti. Aima is considered to be one of the most powerful and strong of the demons and has established her dominance over the country. She is depicted in seating postures and seems to be very powerful. Within the Yaka community, she is regarded as the protector of the children as well as the Swur region, regarded as Takini. It is believed she visits different places and takes care of children under 12 years of age. Harti Mahak is also known as Harti Mazu, Oim Mazu, B Yoga, Mauu Dali, Tak Maasi, etc. According to legends, Harti Azima had many of her children whom she loved and cared for, but to feed the hungry children of her own, she used to abduct and kill the children of others. She used to go to human settlements and Kathmandu Valley every night, kidnapping other children and causing grief to the people of Kathmandu Valley. The bereaved parents of Kathmandu Valley pleaded to the Buddha to save them. One day, Sakyamuni Siddhartha Gautama Buddha, hearing the prayer, found Ananda, the beloved daughter of Harti Mahay Yakini, in the Pinda Patra. After losing her beloved daughter, Ananda, Harti Mahay Yakini wandered around looking for her. Harti Mahay Yakini walked around, wandering in sorrow and weeping. The Buddha then revealed that he was the kidnapper. Buddha pointed out that her own pain at the loss of her only one child of her many children was nothing compared to the loss endured by the parents of her victims, many of whom had lost their only child. The Buddha pointed out that she was suffering because she lost one of her 100 children and asked if she could imagine the suffering of parents whose only child had been devoured. She replied that their suffering must be many times greater than hers. The Buddha explained to her that the children are so dear to every parent, so it would be unwise to cause suffering to people by devouring their children. Buddha made her realize how others felt when she kidnapped, killed, and ate other children. Realizing that she had done grievous wrong, Harti repented and committed herself to protecting all children. Seeing her condition, the Buddha then returned Ananda to her mother. This incident opened the eyes of Harti Mahay Yakshini, and she decided to give up the habit of eating meat by violence. Henceforth, she refrained from killing children and any sentient beings whatsoever and became a protector of them. Harti Azima became the protector of children and women and childbirth. In exchange, the Buddha gave her Bodi, which enabled her to withstand black magic and evil powers, and gave her the power to cure the sick. It is believed that Harti Azima protects one's child since it is in a womb as a fetus. She is also called the second living goddess, and it is believed that she possesses a human body and heals the people in the form of Dima. Lots of rituals are performed in front of Hari Aima as she has been worshiped as a highly respected deity by the natives of Kathmandu Valley. Historically, Harti Azima was often called upon by smallpox victims of particularly deadly diseases that frequently flare in the Kathmandu Valley. Harti Azima was often the only hope of the kings and commoners alike. When Harti Azima failed to intercede to save the life of an 18th-century queen named Ktia Devi in 1799 AD, King RAB Bahadur Saha desecrated the goddess image by quoting an excrement that had the idol destroyed. The statue of Harti Azima was completely destroyed once during the regime of King RAB Bahadur Saha. It is said that an epidemic disease, smallpox, spread throughout the Kathmandu Valley and it killed a lot of children. Then King RAB Bahadur Saha had four queens, and the youngest of all was his beloved one. He had one son from the young queen named Girvan Yudah Pikam Saha. King RAB Bahadur Saha ordered a lot of people of Kathmandu Valley to leave the palace with the fear that smallpox might transfer to his queen and son. Finally, when his queen also suffered from smallpox and the queen died, King RAB Bahadur Saha went to Suu and ordered to lift the statue of Harti Azima, and he destroyed the statue and ordered to throw it away. It is said that when King RAB Bahadur Saha was destroying the statue, the statue cried out loud, and it is said that the statue was thrown near the Vishnumati River. King RAB Bahadur Saha destroyed a lot of statues, and when he went to destroy the doors of Santipur shrine, he lost his vision in one eye and fell there. Later, King RAB Bahadur Saha apologized and established a new statue of Harti Azima in the temple and he started a new tradition of offering gold coins once a year in Santipur and performed Apua every year as an apology for what he did. The king's erratic behavior brought about his own downfall, forcing him to flee to exile in British-held Varanasi. Although RAB Bahadur Saha managed to return to Kathmandu in 1806 AD, he was beheaded by his own half-brother, SI Bahadur Sah.",
