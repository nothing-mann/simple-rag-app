  "description": "Bouddhanath is the biggest stupa in Nepal and it has been a place of pilgrimage and veneration throughout the ages for the entire Buddhists of the world since the very dawn of Nepal’s history. This also has been a place of Buddhist learning and religion since time immemorial. The authentic history of this place based on the evidential facts however, is lacking. Nevertheless, there are few literal and legendary evidences available both in Nepal and Tibet from which some inferences about its historicity can be drawn. Among such legends and traditions still found prevalent in Nepal as well as in Tibet, the story of a lady “Sukontama” by name is the one that gives credit to this lady as responsible to erect this magnificent stupa over the holy corporal relics of the Buddha ‘Kasyapa’, the six moral Buddha in succession. The same story also has the reference of her two sons; Guru Padmasambhava and Dalai, who in order to fulfill their mother’s desire, took several births and preached Buddhism in Tibet. Bouddhanath stupa, largest in dimension and size represents the best example of the Nepalese stupa architectural design. This massive stupa stands over a 3 tired crossed rectangles designed in a tantric Mandala form. The unique and exquisite design has made it a rare and exclusive piece of the traditional Nepalese stupa architectural work. Apart from its exclusive design and style, its massive size and dimension also has made it a distinct piece. The stupa is made out of construction materials like mud, bricks, limestone, metal and wood. It is having an enclosure wall all around it and has a total of 735 metal prayer wheels fixed into its 147 cabinet like chambers. Each prayer wheel contains the popular Buddhist Mantra “Om Mani Padme Humn” embossed on them in the Newari script popularly in uses during the medieval times. The base of the stupa dome is rested up on its three successive tired platforms that are also used as circumambulatory passages. A little above the base of the dome there is a series of recessed niches encircling the entire periphery of dome where a total number of 108 beautifully done stone sculptures of different Buddhist deities have been installed. The stupa has its main entrance on the northern side, from where the devotees can approach to the base of the stupa for a holy circumambulation passing again through the flights of stairs given to the each successive tries which can also be used as a separate circumambulatory passage. These successive tires again have 6 miniature stupas built over them, four to the north and two to its south. To the top of the stupa dome, a square known as Harmika has been erected facing all cardinal directions. Each side has the sketches of the pairs of eyes along with the question marks that are done very artistically. It is said that with these ever-cautious eyes the lord beholds every happening constantly with a very keen attention and so nothing is secret to him. Over this, a thirteen layered wooden rings have been erected, which are according to the Buddhist religious belief, represent the different mental stages of human beings which have to be crossed before attending final salvation, the Nirvana by one who wants to be freed from the worldly bondages. Above this, over a gilded Amalika, in the form of an inverted lotus Patel, a vessel has been placed, which according to the traditions, filled with the water of knowledge. On the top, a gild metal parasol along with a pinnacle is given which is also of a gilded metal.",
