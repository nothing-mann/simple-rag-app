  "description": "Most of the cultural centers of Nepal are concentrated around Kathmandu valley. From the point of view of art and architectural concentration, Kathmandu valley is an open-sky museum. Among those cultural sites, one of the most important one is Hanuman Dhoka Royal Palace that is centrally located Royal Palace in the capital of Nepal. Most of the architectural remains and art objects that we see now within the palace complex are from Malla period and few from Shah and Rana periods of Nepal. Hanuman Dhoka Royal Palace is designed as other royal palaces of Kathmandu Valley with big courtyards, gardens and open spaces for the temples in which Gods and Goddesses reside. The temple is blend of Pagoda, Sikhara style and Dome shaped architectures. The royal palace during medieval period was not erected merely for king and queens but also used as the center of administration, cultural activities and festivals. Hanuman Dhoka Royal Palace also comprised all these activities and thus the architectural buildings were also erected in order to meet those necessities. All the monuments- historical buildings, religious temples and shrines that are concentrated today in and around the palace is the result of the donation by numerous patrons and builders in hundreds of years. They were erected from the time of King Ratna Malla (1484-1520 A.D.) to King Prithvi Bir Bikram Shah (1875-1911 A.D.). King Ratna Malla, the second son of King Yakshya Malla, declared Kantipur as an independent principality in 1484 and separated it from the clutches of Bhaktapur. Bhaktapur was then the capital of entire valley and Patan was still to come into an independent state. Ratna Malla erected a small temple of goddess named Taleju near the place called Tana Bahal. The Goddess Taleju is considered to be the tutelary deity of Malla dynasty. Similarly, King Mahendra Malla contributed a lot to enhance the beauty of the Hanuman Dhoka Palace by enlarging the small temple of Taleju into a marvelous size and made the main courtyard known as the Mul Chowk. All the ritual and ceremonies pertaining to the kings take place in this courtyard. One of the great royal personages born in Malla Dynasty was King Pratap Malla (1641-1674 A.D.) whose reign was marked by high development of literature, religion, culture, art and architecture. He was the forerunner in building activities among all the Malla kings in Kathmandu. He was not only embellished the royal palace but also made a lot of temples and shrines in every corner of Kathmandu. In fact, it was the period, when most of the buildings activities in Kathmandu valley were in the height of progress. There was some sort of competition among three kingdoms Kantipur, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur in building and furnishing their royal palaces with temples and monuments. There was full-scale development in the architecture of royal buildings. King Jaya Prakash Malla, last king of Kantipur in 1756 A.D. added a remarkable monument of Kumari House, in which the living Goddess the Kumari resides even today. The Kumari House is made in the architectural form of a Buddhist Vihar and is decorated with the intricate woodcarvings and terracotta art as well. The inner wall of the monument is further decorated with the freeze art of the day. The monument is called now with different names- Kumari House, Kumari courtyard, and Kumari temple. The site is equally important from cultural, religious and architectural point of view. In addition to these entire monuments, another most important monument is the Kasthamandap that is located to south west of Hanuman Dhoka and was already in existence from 1142 A.D. Although it was made in temple architecture, its function is of a rest house type that serves as the shelter house for the Yogis and Hermits. This monument carries another importance, since last few decades all the state dignitaries are honored in this monument by handling over the key of the Kathmandu city by the city Mayor. The name of the Kathmandu city is derived from this monument that has enhanced the glory of this city. After the conquest of Kantipur by King Prithvi Narayan Shah in 1768 A.D. Kathmandu was declared the capital city of entire country. King Prithvi Narayan Shah erected tallest residential palace in the form of temple architecture and called it a The Nine Storied Palace in 1770 A.D. it is the only residential pagoda style architecture in Nepal. Although short regin, the son of Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Pratap Singh Shah enlarged the temple of Basantapur along with the courtyard occupied by them. King Rana Bahadur Shah added the shrine of god Swet Bhairav and big bell and likewise King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah embellished the main entrance with gold gilding in 1810 A.D. King Rajendra Bikram Shah renovated the main courtyard and Mohan courtyard in 1822 A.D. and paved the floor with flag stones two years earlier. Again next year Nasal courtyard was paved, along with the construction of Sish Palace. Although enlarged, the architectural norms were not much altered during the renovations of those times. During the survey conducted in 1830 the Hanuman Dhoka palace complex was shown quite bigger and wider than today. There were about thirty-five courtyards and the people remember even today that the Hanuman Dhoka Royal Palace included the compound of present Super Market, Bhugol Park Nepal Bank building and the present New Road gate, as its limit. But the area of the present palace has shrink and brought to its present shape due to many reasons, such as the major one being the devastation of the Great Earthquake of 1934, opening the places such as; New Road and Indra Chowk still it is the biggest royal palace complex of the medieval period among all medieval royal palaces in Nepal. There are only ten courtyards left today with its boundary. The Hanuman Dhoka royal palace is included in the protected monument zone along with other private buildings. The cultural activities architectural monuments and art piece in the form of icons images and statues have contributed its glory in the past, present and will enhance even in the future. The world Heritage Committee of UNESCO has inscribed it into its world heritage list as a part of Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site in the year 1979.",
