  "description": "Newari architecture is a unique and ancient style of architecture that has shaped Nepal's identity globally. It is heavily inspired by Hinduism and Buddhism, reflecting the art, culture, and crafts of the Nepalese people. The cultural beauty of Newari architecture manifests in music, dance, festivals, and costumes of the people. Nepalese people are divided into 4 castes and 36 sub-castes, each with their own set of norms and culture. The temples, monasteries, and heritages built in Newari architecture have existed since the 3rd to 5th centuries and have undergone various reformations, especially during the Malla era. These structures hold symbolic meaning and history of Nepal's civilization. The Kathmandu Valley, consisting of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Lalitpur districts, is home to at least 130 monuments, including several pilgrimage sites for Hindus and Buddhists. UNESCO has listed seven World Heritage Sites within this valley, each a testament to the unique architecture and rich culture of Nepal.",
