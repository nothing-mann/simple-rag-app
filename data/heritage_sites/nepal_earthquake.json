  "description": "Nepal faced a huge destruction of its national property: cultural heritages including several calamities in the massive earthquake. These cultural heritages which are the ancient existence have undergone various reformations and will surely be somewhat different after getting renovated even this time. Thus, it is important to preserve its identity in current time for the next generation for whom this would be a history. The major earthquake of 2015 (2072 BS) occurred almost after 80 years which is the recent one and which caused the massive destruction. On 25th April, 2015 Nepal was hit by 7.9 magnitude earthquake making Barpak of Gorkha as its epicenter devastating Kathmandu and its other peripheral districts (Lamjung, Sindhupalchowk , Dhading, Nuwakot, Kavre, Lamjung and Sankhu). Devastation got more serious after the 6.7 magnitude aftershock in the next day of the major earthquake. The death tolls have raised upto 8,786 dead in Nepal (officially) and 8,947 in total 21,952 injured (officially). Over 2 and half lakhs household was destroyed. Rescue and relief support were provided from all over the world including India, Russia, China, USA, Korea etc. Nepali youth mobilization during the emergency time was also quite appreciable and acknowledgeable.",
