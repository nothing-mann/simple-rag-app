  "description": "The Kṛṣṇa Temple is located in the Patan Durbar Square. Thanks to its position, it plays a large role in the general impression of the area around the palace. The east-facing temple is built in a śikhara-style from stone and stands on top of four layered plinths. Two pairs of lions sit on the eastern plinths. In front of the temple, one can find a stone pillar with a metal image of Garuḍa on top of it. The temple is supported by 24 octagonal columns that rise up from its first floor. The story of Ramāyaṇa can be found alongside an explanation in the Newari language inscribed on the lintels of the first floor. A toraṇa containing images of Garuḍa and śivaliṅga is fixed above the entrance. Information regarding the initial construction of the temple can be found on a stone inscription dated NS 757 (1637 CE). This inscription is located to the south of the main entrance.\n\nLocated on the first floor, the main sanctum of the temple contains images of Kṛṣṇa, Rukmiṇī and Satyabhāmā, all of which have been made using black stone. On the floor, one can find images of the Ten Incarnations of Lord Viṣṇu in all four cardinal directions. The Mahābhārata and an explanation in the Newari language have both been inscribed on the lintels of the second floor. A śivaliṅga is enshrined on the second floor of the temple, and Lokeśvara is enshrined on the third floor. Standing on the first and the second floors of the temple, one can see three turrets from every side. Above the second floor are four turrets, one in each of the cardinal directions. All of them are attached to the śikhara structure. The temple contains 21 pinnacles; as such, it is also known as the Temple of 21 Pinnacles. Bernier (1978, 64) says that the temple was made as an imitation of one of the Kṛṣṇa Temples of Mathurā in India. For a more detailed description see Gutschow (2011, 527-531).\n\nSiddhinarasiṃha Malla, one of the Kings of Patan, began the initial construction of this temple on the full moon day of Bhādra of NS 750. The construction was completed on the 10th day of the bright half of NS 757 (Yogī 2013, 57 and Vajrācārya VS 2056, 74-78). It is stated that the artisans of the Jom Bāhāḥ constructed this temple, and that the tools used for its construction are still preserved inside the āgãchẽ of the bāhāḥ (Śākya NS 1128, 22). The earthquake of 1934 did not harm this temple. However, the earthquake of 2015 caused some minor damage. For more information regarding renovation works see N. Das 2016.",

      "description": "The priest family who claim they are the descendants of Harivaṃśa Rājopādhyāya, guru of King Siddhinarasiṃha Malla, perform the daily and other ritual worships of the temple. The priest of this temple performs the role of Narasiṃha in the Kārttika Nāca. During the daily worship, Kṛṣṇa is bathed in the pañcāmṛta in the morning and āratī is performed in the evening. The daily ritual worship is funded by the Guṭhī Saṃsthāna, which provides 1 rupee and 50 paisa every day (Śākya 1128, 62). The anniversary ritual is performed on the 10th day of the Phāguṇa. On this day, tantric worship is performed and a goat is sacrificed. Kṛṣṇajanmāṣṭamī: The 8th day of the dark half of Bhādra is celebrated as the birthday of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Thousands of people come to the temple to take part in the festival. On this occasion, the head of the nation also comes to worship the god. Devaśayana Pūjā: In Hinduism it is believed that, starting on the 11th day of the bright half of the Āṣāḍha (Hariśayanī Ekādaśī) Lord Nārāyaṇa sleeps for four months. Kṛṣṇa an incarnation of Nārāyaṇa, also sleeps in this period. Leaving the main image of this temple standing, another small image of Kṛṣṇa placed nearby the main image. Utthāna Pūjā: The 11th day of the bright half of Kārttika is considered as Haribodhanī Ekādaśī. On the 12th day, the sleeping image of Kṛṣṇa is raised up and worshipped. Mahāsnāna: The mahāsnāna of Kṛṣṇa is performed on the full moon day of the Jyeṣṭha. On that day the golden throne of Śrīnivāsa Malla was presented by Jodhāju of Oku Bāhāḥ (LAL2260) in NS 787. A paubhā (a kind of traditional religious painting) created by King Siddhinarasiṃha Malla containing the chanting of Lord Kṛṣṇa is exhibited. Dolā Yātrā: On the 12th day of the dark half of the Phālguṇa, an image of Kṛṣṇa is placed on a palanquin and swung."
