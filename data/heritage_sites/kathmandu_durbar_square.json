    "description": "Kathmandu Durbar Square is located in the heart of capital Kathmandu. It is one of the three durbar squares in the capital, the other being Patan Durbar Square and Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Unlike the other two durbar squares, this one served as the home for the kings of our country Nepal. After the unification, a big palace was built within the area for the kings to live in, but as of now it serves as a museum. Kathmandu Durbar Square is often known as a place where different kings ruled our country for generations. It is also a home to the living goddess Kumari. The area is a host to a lot of interesting local festivals throughout the year, with Indra Jatra being one of the very well-known festivals that goes on for a week straight.",
