    "description": "The origin and construction of the stupa during the LI period remains rooted in mystery lacking concrete evidence regarding the specific individuals involved. Legend attributes Earth creation to a woman named Sukun or Kaa who, according to F, was once a celestial being punished for stealing flowers from Indra's garden. Reborn as a daughter of an ordinary peak farmer in the Kandu Valley, she sought to build a Buddhist temple losing leftover funds from her father. Despite societal objections to a woman of low caste constructing a temple or donating land for religious purposes, the king granted her the necessary land to support her religious endeavors. Although she passed away before the completion of the construction, her four sons undertook the task of building the stupa, using KPW stone as the foundation. The construction of the stupa took 2555 days. At its inception, Boudhanath Stupa may have been constructed slightly elevated from the ground. However, over time, the stupa has evolved and attained its current form through successive rounds of construction and additions. Located about 5 km from Kathmandu amidst the majestic Himalayas and a bustling market, Boudhanath Stupa is recognized by its gleaming golden pinnacle visible from a distance. However, its true essence is revealed upon entering its presence. The central feature of the stupa is its dome adorned with 13 charts resembling a pyramid-like structure symbolizing the 13 heavens and Buddhist cosmology. The golden spire at the top of the stupa holds great significance. Another notable element is the western eye depicted as a semi-sleeping divine eye situated between the dome and the spire, representing compassion and wisdom in the Buddhist tradition. Buddhists revere the stupa as a sacred lotus flower characterized by the white painted lower dome and the yellow upper portion. Encircling the base of the dome are 108 small shrines housing different Buddha Bodhisattvas. Along the ground level, there are 147 prayer wells lining the perimeter, containing several mantras. Buddhist pilgrims participate in a ritualistic circumambulation around the stupa chanting the mantra 'Om Mani Padme Hum' as they walk, believing that this practice enhances their spiritual devotion. Surrounding Boudhanath Stupa are four meditating Buddha statues, and near the entrance, there is a small shrine housing a silver chasmini shrine along with a large mean. Inside the shrine's mud wall, you can find depictions of the Buddha's biography, although they may be obscured by the smoke from the lamp. The area also contains Buddhist and Hindu prayer beads symbolizing their harmony and tolerance between these two religions. The stupa's base is constructed in a 16-corner mandala orientation aligned from east-west to north-south. Situated amidst residential houses, the stupa exemplifies the harmonious coexistence between a religious site and a residential area, complementing each other. Historically, records from the Gopal genealogy indicate that the stupa was originally built during the LI period and underwent restoration and repairs under the patronage of King Siad in the 6th century, King Pratap Malla in the 17th century, and Lama Mipa in the 20th century. Formerly a hub for traders, the surrounding area was known for its Nar community crafting and selling gold and silver ornaments to Tibetan pilgrims. Today, the trade has shifted towards goods catering to tourists. During Losar, a significant festival for Buddhist pilgrims, devotees traditionally made pilgrimage and engaged in commerce here. After the cultural upheaval in China in 1959, numerous Tibetan refugees settled in the area, altering the trade dynamic towards Chinese goods and commerce in the vicinity of Boudhanath Stupa. Buddhist pilgrims established monasteries aligned with their respective traditions such as Nupa, Sakyapa, Kupa, and Gupa where they studied and taught Buddhism. During Losar, the stupa is adorned with colorful flags as part of the festivities reflecting the dominance of the northern region refugees and their cultural influence in the area referred to as Kasaan Mahako Chya in the Tibetan language and mentioned in Gopal Vabali. The local lamas exhibit a distinctive way of walking not commonly seen among the pilgrims of the Kathmandu Valley. Presently, a Chinese lama representing the Tibetan Lama recites a potion often inherited from father to son with other lamas under his supervision. Visitors can explore the whole area witnessing the Himalayas and engaging with the monasteries to learn about the daily life, culture, and tradition of the Buddhist community surrounding Boudhanath Stupa. Each monastery structure, layout, and decoration are similar featuring depictions of Jataka stories on the interiors predominantly using golden hues with varied color on the ceiling. According to Buddhist practice, worship rooms are meticulously maintained welcoming visitors at any time. Experiencing the true ambiance often requires participation in daily worship rituals. After Nepal signed the World Heritage Convention in 1978 facilitated by UNESCO to support the repair and preservation of palaces, temples, and shrines built at various times, seven significant sites in Kathmandu Valley were inscribed on the World Heritage list in 1979. UNESCO has urged international organizations to aid in safeguarding these heritages and support has been received from various countries including Boudhanath Stupa which is among the seven designated monuments. The proliferation of tall buildings near the stupa has indirectly impacted Boudhanath Stupa and its surrounding environment. Non-compliance with standards set by the Department of Archaeology poses challenges with issues such as environmentally unfriendly window design, excessive use of grills instead of wood, cement structures replacing traditional roofing materials, and deviation from approved height limits. Despite assurances of adhering to standards with Department of Archaeology approval, instances of non-compliant construction processes have occurred. The proliferation of small shops along the circumambulation path around the stupa has negatively impacted the ambiance and created inconvenience for tourists. Nevertheless, Boudhanath Stupa continues to serve as a vital spiritual and cultural hub in Kathmandu drawing pilgrims, tourists, and Buddhist practitioners from across the globe.",

    "description": "Boudhanath Stupa is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it is the largest stupa in Nepal. It is also one of the holiest Tibetan Buddhist temples outside of Tibet. The monument shape is a pagoda mandala, which is a cosmological map to enlightenment or Bodhi. This is where it got its name from. When you're inside the temple, it is a world of its own. Every bit of Boudhanath temple represents elements of life and a path to enlightenment, like the triangle at the top of the tower. The triangular shape represents fire. The top of the tower has a gilded canopy representing air. The tower is topped by a pyramid with three steps representing a ladder to enlightenment, and there are hundreds of prayer flags tied to the stupa fluttering in the wind, carrying the mantras from the earth to the heavens.",
    "fun_fact": "Everywhere you'll see visitors and devotees circumnavigating around the dome, spinning the prayer wheels. The prayer wheels have mantras written all over them and at the core of the wheel is what is called a life tree, usually made up of wood or metal.",
