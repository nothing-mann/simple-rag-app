    "description": "The origin and construction of the stupa during the LI period remains rooted in mystery, lacking concrete evidence regarding the specific individuals involved. Legend attributes Earth creation to a woman named Sukun or Kaa, who according to F was once a Celestial being punished for stealing flowers from Indra's garden. Reborn as a daughter of an ordinary peak farmer in the Kandu valley, she sought to build a Buddhist temple, losing leftover funds from her father. Despite societal objections to a woman of low caste constructing a temple or donating land for religious purposes, the king granted her the necessary land to support her religious endeavors. Although she passed away before the completion of the construction, her four sons undertook the task of building the stupa, using KPW stone as the foundation. The construction of the stupa took 2555 days at its inception. Boudhanath Stupa may have been constructed slightly elevated from the ground, akin to the Aso Stupa in PN. However, over time, the stupa has evolved and attained its current form through successive rounds of construction and additions. Located about 5 km from Kathmandu amidst the majestic Himalayas and a bustling market, Boudhanath Stupa is recognized by its gleaming golden pinnacle visible from a distance. However, its true essence is revealed upon entering its presence. The central feature of the stupa is its dome adorned with 13 charts resembling a pyramid-like structure, symbolizing the 13 heavens and the Buddhist cosmology. The golden spire at the top of the stupa holds great significance. Another notable element is the western eye depicted as a semi-sleeping divine eye situated between the dome and the tis, representing compassion and wisdom in the Buddhist tradition. Buddhists revere the stupa as a sacred lotus flower characterized by the white painted lower dome and the yellow upper portion. Encircling the base of the dome are 108 small shrines housing different Buddha Bodhisattvas. Along the ground level, there are 147 prayer wells lining the perimeter east, containing several mantras. Buddhist pilgrims participate in a ritualistic circumambulation around the stupa, chanting the mantra 'Om Mani Padme Hum' as they walk, believing that this practice enhances their spiritual devotion. Surrounding Boudhanath Stupa are four meditating Buddha statues, and near the entrance, there is a small shrine housing a silver chas mini shrine along with a large mean. Inside the shrine's mud wall, you can find depictions of the Buddha's biography, although they may be obscured by the smoke from the lamp. The area also contains Buddhist and Hindu prayer beads symbolizing their harmony and tolerance between these two religions. The stupa's base is constructed in a 16-corner mandala orientation aligned from east-west to north-south. Situated amidst residential houses, the stupa exemplifies the harmonious coexistence between a religious site and a residential area, complementing each other. Historically, records from the Gopal genealogy indicate that the stupa was originally built during the LI period and underwent restoration and repairs under the patronage of King Siad in the 6th century, King Pratap Malla in the 17th century, and Lama Mipa in the 20th century. Formerly a hub for traders, the surrounding area was known for its Nar community crafting and selling gold and silver ornaments to Tibetan pilgrims. Today, the trade has shifted towards goods catering to tourists. During Losar, a significant festival for Buddhist pilgrims, devotees traditionally made pilgrimage and engaged in commerce here. After the cultural upheaval in China in 1959, numerous Tibetan refugees settled in the area, altering the trade dynamic towards Chinese goods and commerce in the vicinity of Boudhanath Stupa. Buddhist pilgrims established monasteries aligned with their respective traditions such as Nupa, Sakyapa, Kupa, and Gupa, where they studied and taught Buddhism. During Losar, the stupa is adorned with colorful flags as part of the festivities, reflecting the dominance of the northern region refugees and their cultural influence in the area referred to as Kasaan Mahako Chya in Tibetan language and mentioned in Gopal Vabali. The local Lamas exhibit a distinctive way of walking not commonly seen among the pilgrims of the Kathmandu Valley. Presently, a Chinese Lama representing the Lama recites a portion often inherited from father to son with other Lamas under his supervision. Visitors can explore the whole area, witnessing the Himalayas and engaging with the monasteries to learn about the daily life, culture, and tradition of the Buddhist community surrounding Boudhanath Stupa. Each monastery structure, layout, and decoration are similar, featuring depictions of Jataka stories on the interiors, predominantly using golden hues with varied colors on the ceiling. According to Buddhist practice, worship rooms are meticulously maintained, welcoming visitors at any time. Experiencing the true ambiance often requires participation in daily worship rituals. After Nepal signed the World Heritage Convention in 1978, facilitated by UNESCO to support the repair and preservation of palaces, temples, and shrines built at various times, seven significant sites in the Kathmandu Valley were inscribed on the World Heritage list in 1979. UNESCO has urged international organizations to aid in safeguarding these heritages, and support has been received from various countries, including Boudhanath Stupa, which is among the seven designated monuments. The proliferation of tall buildings near the stupa has indirectly impacted Boudhanath Stupa and its surrounding environment. Non-compliance with standards set by the Department of Archaeology poses challenges with issues such as environmentally unfriendly window design, excessive use of grills instead of wood, cement structures replacing traditional roofing materials, and deviation from approved height limits. Despite assurances of adhering to standards with Department of Archaeology approval, instances of non-compliant construction processes have occurred. The proliferation of small shops along the circumambulation path around the stupa has negatively impacted the ambiance and created inconvenience for tourists. Nevertheless, Boudhanath Stupa continues to serve as a vital spiritual and cultural hub in Kathmandu, drawing pilgrims, tourists, and Buddhist practitioners from across the globe.",

    "description": "Bouddhanath is the biggest stupa in Nepal and it has been a place of pilgrimage and veneration throughout the ages for the entire Buddhists of the world since the very dawn of Nepal's history. This also has been a place of Buddhist learning and religion since time immemorial. The authentic history of this place based on the evidential facts however, is lacking. Nevertheless, there are few literal and legendary evidences available both in Nepal and Tibet from which some inferences about its historicity can be drawn. Among such legends and traditions still found prevalent in Nepal as well as in Tibet, the story of a lady \"Sukontama\" by name is the one that gives credit to this lady as responsible to erect this magnificent stupa over the holy corporal relics of the Buddha 'Kasyapa', the six moral Buddha in succession. The same story also has the reference of her two sons; Guru Padmasambhava and Dalai, who in order to fulfill their mother's desire, took several births and preached Buddhism in Tibet. Bouddhanath stupa, largest in dimension and size represents the best example of the Nepalese stupa architectural design. This massive stupa stands over a 3 tired crossed rectangles designed in a tantric Mandala form. The unique and exquisite design has made it a rare and exclusive piece of the traditional Nepalese stupa architectural work. Apart from its exclusive design and style, its massive size and dimension also has made it a distinct piece. The stupa is made out of construction materials like mud, bricks, limestone, metal and wood. It is having an enclosure wall all around it and has a total of 735 metal prayer wheels fixed into its 147 cabinet like chambers. Each prayer wheel contains the popular Buddhist Mantra \"Om Mani Padme Humn\" embossed on them in the Newari script popularly in uses during the medieval times. The base of the stupa dome is rested up on its three successive tired platforms that are also used as circumambulatory passages. A little above the base of the dome there is a series of recessed niches encircling the entire periphery of dome where a total number of 108 beautifully done stone sculptures of different Buddhist deities have been installed. The stupa has its main entrance on the northern side, from where the devotees can approach to the base of the stupa for a holy circumambulation passing again through the flights of stairs given to the each successive tries which can also be used as a separate circumambulatory passage. These successive tires again have 6 miniature stupas built over them, four to the north and two to its south. To the top of the stupa dome, a square known as Harmika has been erected facing all cardinal directions. Each side has the sketches of the pairs of eyes along with the question marks that are done very artistically. It is said that with these ever-cautious eyes the lord beholds every happening constantly with a very keen attention and so nothing is secret to him. Over this, a thirteen layered wooden rings have been erected, which are according to the Buddhist religious belief, represent the different mental stages of human beings which have to be crossed before attending final salvation, the Nirvana by one who wants to be freed from the worldly bondages. Above this, over a gilded Amalika, in the form of an inverted lotus Patel, a vessel has been placed, which according to the traditions, filled with the water of knowledge. On the top, a gild metal parasol along with a pinnacle is given which is also of a gilded metal.",
    "fun_fact": "Bouddhanath has been a very sacred Buddhist pilgrimage site for most of the Buddhists of the world. It also has been center of Buddhist learning and religious activities since very long. This place, especially for the devoted coming from Tibet, has greater religious significance. Even today hundreds and thousands of devotees from come here every year to pay their homage to the lord.",
