  "description": "This octagonal stone Śhikara temple was built in NS 843 (CE 1723) by Yogamatī, the daughter of Yoganarendra Malla. The main entrance faces east and is guarded by two lions as well as statues of Jaya and Vijaya. A second door faces west, and the six remaining sides feature blind doors. Kṛṣṇa, the principal deity, is installed on the first floor alongside his two consorts Satyabhāmā and Rukminī. The first floor balcony is decorated with an intricately carved stone balustrade featuring 32 deities in stone relief.\n\nThe stone inscription placed at the blind door on the southern side of the temple informs the reader that this octagonal stone Śhikara temple was built in NS 843 (CE 1723) by Yogamatī, the daughter of Yoganarendra Malla. The temple collapsed completely in the 1934 earthquake and was rebuilt from the ground up in the late 1930s. The overall quality of reconstruction was relatively poor, with parts of the stone balcony showing severe defects. The temple was severely damaged again in the 2015 earthquake and has been temporarily reinforced by two stainless steel collar bands. There are many cracks in the stone masonry, resulting in severe water leakage into the structure.",
