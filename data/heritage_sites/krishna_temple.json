    "description": "King City Nursing Mala of Patan built the Krishna Temple in Mangal Bazar of Patan in the courtyard of Patton Palace. It was built around 1693 Bikram Sambat. The temple was established as a copy of another Hindu temple of Lord Krishna present in Mathura in India by City Nursing Mala Patan. The temple is entirely built with stone and does not contain wood or bronze for any kind of support. It is also said that the entire temple was built with one stone alone. There is an interesting reason behind placing the idols of Shiva and Krishna in the same temple. Towards the end of the 17th century, there was a boost on the site of the present Krishna Temple. This land was prepared to be built for Shiva's temple. Legend says that Krishna Temple was inspired by a dream; one night, King City Nursing Mala dreamed that the gods Krishna and Radha were standing in front of the palace, so the king ordered a temple built on the same location. According to the legend, an idol of Lord Krishna was found while cutting down a bush. Since the idol of Krishna was found and the land allotted for the Sivalaya was set aside, City Nursing started worshiping the idols of Shiva and Krishna. Religious King City Nursing Mala used to perform havan in the years Nakunda regularly. Even on the day he dreamed, the smoke that came out during the same havan took the shape of the present Krishna Temple. It is believed that the temple was built in the Seeker's child on the same basis. Generally, most of the temples in Nepal are built in Pagoda Style, but this is built in Seeker's style, and one can see the influence of Dravidian and Mughal style also. The Krishna Temple is also known as the first temple built in Seeker Style. It took six and a half years to build this temple. This temple is considered to be a very rare type with a total of 21 gujures. The 21 gujures in Krishna Temple also have different meanings. During the regular havan after King City Nursing Mala, 21 urns were installed. The name of the urns was also different; however, the name of the urns is not mentioned in the inscription of the temple. It is believed that 21 gujures were made to represent the urn after the same urn was born in the yagna. This temple is made of stone and has 21 gujures, which is the most in Nepal. During a war with the neighboring kingdom, King City Nursing Mala emerged victorious after calling on Krishna to vanquish his enemies. In gratitude, the king built a replica of the temple inside the Sundaricho courtyard. Outside the temple is a statue of the 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu. There is a statue of the first incarnation in the east corner, and the idols of various incarnations of God Vishnu are placed in the clockwise direction. On the first floor of the temple, one can see the carved image and script depicting the events of Mahabharata, and the second floor has a carving depicting the Ramayana. The first floor has Krishna, the second Shiva in the form of linga, and the third location. Among its three floors, there is a statue of Sri Krishna on the middle floor. There are 10 avatars of Vishnu around the statue of Krishna. This area is listed as a World Heritage Site. In front of this temple, there is a statue of Garuda, the mount of Vishnu, kneeling with outstretched arms on top of a pillar facing the temple, and on the back of the statue of Garuda is Kotihu Manda. Non-Hindus are prohibited from entering the temple. Every year, a huge number of worshipers throng the temple during the Festival of Krishna Janmashtami, or Krishna's birthday, held in August or September."
