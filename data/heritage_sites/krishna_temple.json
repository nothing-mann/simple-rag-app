  "description": "King City Nursing Mala of Barton built the Krishna Temple in Mangal Bazar of Patan in the courtyard of Patton Palace. It was built around 1693 Bikram Sambad. The temple was established as a copy of another Hindu temple of Lord Krishna present in Mathura in India by City Nursing Mala Patan. The temple is entirely built with stone and does not contain wood or bronze for any kind of support. It is also said that the entire temple was built with one stone alone. There is an interesting reason behind placing the idols of Shiva and Krishna in the same temple. Towards the end of the 17th century, there was a boost on the site of the present Krishna Temple. This land was prepared to be built for Shiva's temple. Legend says that Krishna Temple was inspired by a dream. One night, King City Nursing Mala dreamed that the gods Krishna and Radha were standing in front of the palace, so the king ordered a temple built on the same location. According to the legend, an idol of Lord Krishna was found while cutting down a bush. Since the idol of Krishna was found, the land allotted for the Sivalaya was set aside. City Nursing started worshiping the idols of Shiva and Krishna. Religious King City Nursing Mala used to perform havan in the years Nakunda regularly. Even on the day he dreamed, the smoke that came out during the same havan took the shape of the present Krishna Temple.

This temple is considered to be a very rare type with a total of 21 gujures. The 21 gujures in Krishna Temple also have different meanings. During the regular havan after King City Nursing Mala, 21 urns were installed. The name of the urns was also different; however, the name of the urns is not mentioned in the inscription of the temple. It is believed that 21 gujures were made to represent the urn after the same urn was born in the yajna. This temple is made of stone and has 21 gujures, which is the most in Nepal. During a war with the neighboring kingdom at the cat later, King City Nursing Mala emerged victorious after calling on Krishna to vanquish his enemies. In gratitude, the king built a replica of the temple inside the Sundaricho courtyard. Outside the temple is a statue of the 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu.
