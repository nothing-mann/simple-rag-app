  "description": "The Pashupatinath shrine is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and is one of the holiest Hindu Shrines. It is located on the banks of holy river Bagmati that eventually merges with the Ganges. The Hindus consider Pashupatinath as the ‘Head Place’ of Lord Shiva and Banaras in India as his ‘Foot Place’. Pashupatinath is most revered both by Hindus and Buddhists setting a shining example of religious tolerance and harmony. The age-long historic and cultural values of this Pashupati area are recognized worldwide. The World Heritage Committee of UNESCO has inscribed it into its world heritage list as a part of Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site in the year 1979. According to the ancient Hindu religious text known as Skandapurana, Lord Shiva once lived in the Mrigasthali forest in the form of a deer, with a body of golden sheen and one single golden horn. Disquieted by the lord’s long absence from the midst, the other gods went searching for Shiva. After a constant search, they found him frolicking among the bushes. They began by offering prayers to him. As Shiva did not respond, Lord Indra, Brahma, and Vishnu caught the deer by its golden horn. As soon as they took the horn, it broke into three pieces, leaving each god holding one piece. One of the pieces soared into the sky and the second piece dived into the earth, and the third that remained in their grip the gods took away with them. They later placed the horn piece on a mound at a place called Gokarna as a sign of the lord. Ages after, however, it rose from the mound and came flying to settle permanently at the spot where the devotional object representing the lord Shiva called Jyotirlinga today stands. The divine horn piece remained buried for ages, until a cowherd in the form of Jyotirlinga unearthed it. It is said that a cow used to spill some milk from her udders over a particular spot before she returned home after the day’s grazing. The owner of the cow would find that the milk of the cow had run short. After a brief watch-over, the cowherd came to know the reason. One day he and his man went to the spot and dug a pit and found, to their awe, a fiery phallus lying deep down. Unable to withstand the blaze of the fire, the cowherds hurriedly covered the pit with the earth. Later, they installed an object representing Lord Shiva the Linga on the spot. There is no dated record showing when the temple of Lord Pashupatinath was first built. It is assumed that it was initially a simple structure of stone of some proportion that must have been rebuilt a number of times in the course of its development. The Pashupati Temple was constructed under the Somadeva Dynasty in the 3rd Century BC. It is recorded that it was built and provided with a golden roof by King Shiva Deva III around 1120 AD. In 1360 the lingam was replaced and King Bhupatindra Malla further renovated the temple in 1754. It possibly got its present shape under King Jayasthiti Malla in the late 14th century. Much later Prime Minister Chandra Shamsher reshaped the surroundings of the temple to its present state around 1920. In 1959 King Mahendra Shah renovated the temple and its surroundings, giving them a Newari look. After the establishment of the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT) in 1987, it has prepared a master plan of the area and taking care of the maintenance and repairs within it. The Pashupati temple stands in the middle of an open courtyard. There are many entrances including the main western gate, the eastern stairway from the Arya Ghat, and the Southern gateway. While entering from the Southern gateway, one comes across Chausathi Mahadev courtyard with 64 Shiva lingams and a circular temple in the center known as Kotilingeshwor. King Pratap Malla built it in 1654 AD. The four doors of the temple are silver and gilt-plated and heavily decorated with painted images of deities. Numerous struts adorned with beautifully carved images of various Hindu gods support both the copper roofs. The main image, which lies in the center of the cellar, is known as the Mukhyalinga that is about one meter high. There is a circumambulatory path around the Pashupatinath temple. Small steps are built into the plinth on all sides and lead to the four doors of the temple. Magnificent metal lions guard these. A huge trident presented by Vrisadeva’s in front of the northern door. Facing the western door are two Nandi Bulls. Near the Nandi Bull is an image of Hanuman, the monkey god that is draped with red cloth and stained with vermilion. There are many similar shrines surrounding the temple like those of Annapurna, Ganesh, and Suryanarayan. Towards the northeast corner of the courtyard is the temple of Basuki, one of the Snake kings. King Pratap Malla built the temple in the mid-17th century. Behind the Basuki temple, there is another small courtyard that houses the shrine of Badrinath. In front of the steps from the eastern gate, there is a replica of Buddanilkantha and shrines and images of Narayan and Lal Ganesh. The cluster of five shrines in the south of Pashupati Temple is known as Panchadeval. These shrines are built above four tiers of brick foundation. It has a long stone-topped plinth in the north and south. This shrine complex contains other 14 shrines built in different periods. The Dharmasala in the five complex serves as a home for the elderly. Devout Hindus prefer to spend their last moment of their life in this holy place. Consequently, many buildings along the west bank of the river are dedicated to the elderly, the dying, terminally ill, and funerary functions. At the foot of the temple of Pashupati and along the bank of the Bagmati River, the Arya Ghat is believed to be the most sacred funerary ground in the Kathmandu Valley. The Ghat is composed of a long strip of paved platforms forming steps to the river. The platforms for royal and distinguished people are located in the top tier. In the Arya Ghat, the shrines of Gangamai and Virupaksha situated next to the eastern gateway. Cremation takes place on the funerary platforms of ghats, located along the riverbank. The body covered in a katro (white cloth) is transported to the ghats on bamboo stretchers. Relatives and caste members follow on foot in the procession called Malami. The Kiriya Putri buildings where post-cremation rituals are performed were renovated recently. The mourners can stay in the rent house throughout the mourning period of 13 days, after which they perform a puja (worship) and return home. Place named Deopatan is an old Newar settlement lies in the west of Pashupati. The foundation of Deopatan village dates back to the Licchavi times (3rd-8th century). Its streets were laid out in the form of bow and arrow with the arrow pointing at the main Shiva Shrine. Since Pashupati’s earliest history, the priests of Pashupati lived here. Today, it is still home to a large local community of priests and others who work at the temple. Through the traditional fabric of the village has disappeared, there still exist many scattered shrines throughout Deopatan. The Gujeshwori temple is located northeast, down the hill and on the banks of the river. Legends recount that when Shiva discovered that his wife Sati has burnt herself alive after being insulted, he raged with grief and scattered her charred body in the 51 sacred places. From the Gujeshwori temple, a lane follows the river downstream, turning back to the main Pashupati complex. The road passed the Kirateshwor Mahadev Temple on the right which hosts Nepali classical music concerts on the full moon evenings. A little further downstream, at the opposite bank is the Gaurighat, where the Bagmati enters Pashupati ravine. Here the road crosses the river and circles back to Pashupati. Just across the bridge, a smaller path provides a short-cut taking to the Kailash Hill. The little hill is named after the Tibetan sacred mountain that Shiva chooses as a meditation spot. At the eastern edge of Kailash, a steep staircase leads down to the Surya Ghat, the site of several caves hewn out of the cliffs. These caves have been used for meditation for centuries and are sometimes still occupied by Sadhus. Among others, the famous doom roof temple of Vishwaroop; two-tiered pagoda of Batsaleswori temple in the south-east bank of Bagmati River and Bhubaneshwori temple in the south-west corner of Pashupati temple; and three-tiered pagoda of Jayabageshwori Temple in the south-west of Pashupati area are some of the famous sites for Hindu devotees in this area.",
