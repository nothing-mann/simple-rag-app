  "description": "I am Fulmaya and he is Pasang. We are part of one family and live in one village. And this village is very big. We have to cross many forests, mountains, lakes and deserts to get from our houses to yours. That is why we have not played together before. Animals and plants of all shapes, sizes and colours live with us. Some of them like the tigers and the one-horned rhinos live near us in Chitwan National Park. It makes us very sad that these neighbours are losing their jungle homes. Our village also has many old palaces, statues and cities built by our ancestors. You may have heard about beautiful places like the Pyramids of Egypt and the Taj Mahal of India. But did you know that Nepal also has many incredible places? All these places including cities and forests are our heritage. Our parents and their parents and their parentâ€™s parents have looked after our heritage for hundreds of years. They took care of it so that today we can enjoy the beautiful nature and the great monuments. Now our whole village must work together to watch over our heritage for our children and grandchildren. Many of these sites and monuments are so special that people all over the world are trying to protect them. What a great loss it would be if they were destroyed! Luckily, UNESCO helps us. It has written an important text with a complicated name: Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. We can call it the World Heritage Convention. There is also the World Heritage List with almost one thousand of the most important sites and monuments. The World Heritage Convention and the World Heritage List are there to protect our heritage. The World Heritage Committee with its members from 21 countries watch over the sites. But they cannot do this without us. We want to help UNESCO preserve our heritage. And we want you to help too.",
