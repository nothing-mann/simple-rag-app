  "description": "In ancient times, Kathmandu was in the form of a big lake. The lake was called NagDaha and was renowned as Kingdom of snakes. The lake was surrounded on all sides by hills and mountains. The lake was considered as a holy place. Many sages and religious people would come to bathe in this holy lake. During Golden Age, Vipasvi Buddha (known as first Buddha) after hearing about this holy place came to this place on full moon day of month Chaitra to take a bath. After taking a bath, he threw a lotus seed into the middle of the lake. The seed transformed into a lotus flower with a thousand petals in the middle of the lake. A self perpetuating celestial light appeared in the lotus flower. During that time, God Brahma, Vishnu, Mahadev, Vayudev, Agnidev, Indra, Laxmi, Saraswati along with other gods and goddesses came to worship the light. They worshipped and honored the celestial light as Aadi Buddha. Information about this light became circulated all around and reached to the ears of Buddhist saint, Manjushri Boddhisattva as well. Upon hearing about the light, he went to worship the light with his two wives, Keshini and Upakeshini, Dharmakar and some of his consorts. When they arrived and saw the celestial light, Keshini said, 'This is such a big, bright and beautiful lake. I have never seen such a lake on Earth.' They stood at the lake and felt as if it was paradise on Earth. They wondered if the light was a star or some powerful source. Upon hearing these different opinions, Manjushri Boddhisattva said, 'The luminous and floating light which has come from the lotus is the Swayambhu Jyoti, the self-appearing light of Aadi Buddha.' 'Beings without supernatural powers cannot visit this beautiful lake. Let's see if we can make this lake habitable and accessible for all.' Then, Manjusri asked his students to follow him around the lake. Manjusri held a sword called Chandrahasa in his right hand and a book called Prajna Paramita Sutra in his left hand. During their walk, they established goddess Varada in Phulchowk and goddess Mokshada in Dhyanocho. Then they went to lower hills of Chovar, where they erected an idol of Ganesh and bowed. He worshipped the God and chanted some prayers. If the water of the lake be drained out, the valley will be habitable and Swayambhu will be accessible to all. He asked for blessings and cleft the hill with his khadga. The hill quaked and water rushed out with great thunder through the gorge. Manjusri, Keshini, Upakeshini and his followers prayed for the success. When the lake was completely drained away, a newly habitable city was settled. The city now popularly known as Kathmandu. At that time, Dharmakar was appointed as King of this city. In this way, Swayambhu jyoti became accessible to all the human beings. One day, a King named as Prachandadev came to worship the Swayambhu light. To protect and preserve the light from evil, he made Swayambhu chaitya covering the Swayambhu Jyoti. Five chapels were established around the Swayambhu chaitya. Inside these five chapels, five Dhyani Buddhas are enshrined. viz. Akshabhya, Ratnasambhava, Vairochana, Amoghasiddhi, and Amitabh. These five chapels represent air, earth, water, fire and sky. Swoyambhu stupa also has four taras: Lochani, Marnaki, Pandura and Aryatara. There are about 315 stone-steps which lead to Swayambhu stupa. Near the stupa, on each side of stairs there are stone carved lions, elephants, peacocks, horses and Garudas. They represent the vehicles of five Dhyani Buddhas. At the end of the steps, there is big gilt 'vajra' which is believed to be erected by King Pratap Malla. Swayambhu stupa can be defined as follows: The white dome of stupa represents the world. A large pair of eyes on each of the four sides of the stupa represents a pervasive vision that protects mankind from destruction. A sign of interrogation between these eyes looks like Nepali number 1 and gives message of unity in the world. This stupa is believed to be 2000 years old and considered as one of the most religious sites.",
