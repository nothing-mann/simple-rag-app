    "description": "Swoyambhunath is one of the holiest pilgrimage centers in the Kathmandu valley equally venerable for both the Buddhists as well as the Hindus. It is a great center of reverence not only to the people of Nepal, but also to all the peace loving people of the world. Beautiful view of Swoyambhu hill can be observed from almost all parts of Kathmandu valley and the entire Kathmandu valley can be seen from the eastern side of the Swoyambhu hilltop. Therefore, tourists love to observe the Kathmandu valley from this point. The cultural as well as the natural heritages of this hill is very important and valuable which is situated in the west of Kathmandu city. The site is most graceful with the greenery of age-old botanical species that grow on this hill and it has been the habitat of the monkeys through the ages. The story of Swoyambhu is closely associated with the origin of Kathmandu valley. According to the Swoyambhu inscription, the valley in the beginning was a big and beautiful lake known as “Kalidaha”. The legend further explains that the Vipaswi Buddha came here and sowed a lotus seed in this beautiful lake that grew up and bloomed with thousand petals. On that very flower a dark-blue flame emanated and it is known as Swoyambhu Jyoti that can be translated as self-originated flame. Having heard about this strange incident, pilgrims began to visit this lake to pay homage to this auspicious flame. Among the pilgrims Mahamanjushree from Tibet came with his two spouses known as Varada and Mokshada. After paying homage to the Swoyambhu Jyoti, he planned to drain the water out from the lake. Finally by cutting out the narrow slit in the hill at Chobhar with the help of his spouses Varada and Mokshada, he drained the water of the lake and dried out lake was converted into a valley suitable for human settlement. Accordingly, a Stupa was erected in the place where the Swoyambhu Jyoti had emerged. That very Stupa has been known as the Swoyambhu Mahachaitya. There is a lack of proper historical and archaeological evidence to prove the legend based statement mentioned above. Although, proper evidences but the lacustrine origin of the valley do not support the historical city of the origin of Swayambhu is confirmed by the geological studies. Based on ancient holy books and local chronicles, it shows that human occupation in the valley might have started during the first millennium BC. According to the legend related to the Swayambhu Stupa, its history can be linked with the history of human settlement in the valley. However, authentic evidences as to the historicity of the Stupa have been found only from the Licchavi period of Nepali history. The Licchavi inscriptions, stone sculptures and stone monoliths of miniature Stupa are the earliest historical and archaeological evidences scattered around. On the basis of such evidences scattered around. On the basis of such evidences most of the scholars of Nepalese history believe that the earliest phase of the construction of the Swoyambhu Stupa had occurred around the beginning of 5th century and the credit of this noble work goes to the Licchavi King Vrisadeva. The Gopal Raj Vamsavali, a well-known Nepalese chronicle mentions that king Vrisadeva, the great grandfather of Licchavi king Mandeva 1st of 5th century had constructed the Chaityabhattaraka in Swoyambhu. With this reference most of the scholars have credited to King Vrisadeva as the founder of this Stupa. Though, some scholars believe that Monk Shantarakshita of 8th century was the founder of this Stupa but later Buddhist Literary works credited to Monk Shantikaracharya for the construction of the Stupa in present shape and size and also erected five shrines for its protection which are popularly known as Agnipura, Nagapura, Vayupur, Vasupura and Shantipura. The Swoyambhu Monastery, as believed by the scholars, was a simple mud mound until its repair and enlargement in the Licchavi period. However, nothing is known about the shape and size of that time. At the beginning of early medieval period of Nepali history, the Vajrayana under the Mahayana Buddhism was in culmination of its development and very popular in Nepal and Tibet. Vajrayana philosophy was materialized in different art and architectural forms. The present physical form of this Stupa was also designed during that time under the strong influence of Vajrayanism. One can observe heavy influences not only in the art and architectural forms but also in the rich cultural traditions found in Swoyambhunath area. Therefore, scholars use to mention this site as a “Cradle of Vajrayana Buddhism”. According to Vajrayana Buddhism, Swoyambhu is a symbol of Void represented the creator of this universe and by Adi Buddha from whom all the Panchadhyani Buddhas, Bodhisattvas emerged out. This philosophical concept of the Vajrayana Buddhism is materialized in the form of a stupa. The present form of this Swoyambhu Stupa represents all these aspects of Vajrayana philosophy. The hemispherical dome is erected right from the level of circumambulation passage and encircled by five Dhyani Buddhas and their consorts each enshrined in a gilded niche spaced around the stupa. They along with their Bodhisattava and family, represent the five elements as mentioned in the Vajrayana principle. The Dhyanibuddha Vairochana his consort Vajradhateswari also known as Vairochani represents the central part of the dome. Moreover, in most unusual that Vairochana is supposed to occupy its place inside the center of the stupa but enjoys a shrine adjacent to Akshobhya on the eastern side. The Dhyanibuddha Aksyobhya his consort Saptalochani, bodhisattva Vajrapani, element sky and Abhiratibhuvana, represents the eastern part of this dome. The Dhyanibuddha Ratnasambhava, his consort Mamki, Bodhisattava Ratnapani, element the earth and Ratnavatibhuvana represent the southern part of this dome. The western side of the dome represented by the Dhyanibuddha Amitabha, his consort Pandara bodhisattva Padmanpani, element fire and Sukhavatibhuvana. The Dhyanibuddha Amoghasiddhi, his consort Tara, Bodhisattava Viswapani, element Air and Amoghavatibhuvana, presents the northern part of the dome. The cubic form of construction immediately above the dome is called Harmika. It is believed that eyes painted on it belong to the Dhyanibuddha Vairochana and is extending the sight of knowledge peace and compassion to all four directions. They are also called “Vajradristi” and “Sunyadristi”. The conch shell like sign in between the eyes is called 'Urna'. It is believed that the “Urna” is one among the thirty-two auspicious signs found on the body of Lord Buddha. The gold plated bronze rings above the Harmika are called Trayodashabhuvana. They represent thirteen stages of disciplinary world to reach Nirvana. The Usnisha or Usnishachudamani is resting on the top of central wooden shaft or the “Yasti”. Above the Usnisha the golden parasol is surmounted. It is also called “Chudamanichhatra” or “Dharmachhatra”. The gold gilded big Vajra and Mandala of bronze is in the eastern part of the stupa is one of the holiest objects kept in this area. The Vajra is rested on a bronze Mandala around which twelve different animals representing twelve months of Tibetan calendar are depicted. It is also believed that the Vajradhatumandala is the symbolic representation of Dhyanibuddha Akshyobhya. King Pratap Malla installed the Vajra in the middle of 17th century AD. He carried out many construction works in this Swoyambhu hill, the construction of Pratapapura and Anantapura temples are important among them. There are several other sites in Swayambhu such as; Harati Temple, Vasupura, Vayupura, Devadharma Mahavihara, Bhutani Gumba, Jyotikirti Mahavihara, Samhegun Vihara, Agnipura, Shantipura, Nagapura, Karmaraj Mahavihara, Anantapura and Vasubhandhu Chaitya. The outstanding cultural and architectural value of this Swayambhu Stupa and surrounding monuments has been recognized by the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO and inscribed it in the world Heritage List in 1979. This Stupa now has become a pride of mankind of the World and the Government of Nepal is paying its special attention in conserving the monuments and in protecting the historical and cultural environment of this site. For the proper and systematic conversation, this site has been declared a Protected Monument Zone and a master plan has been envisaged and is being executed by the Department of Archaeology.",

    "description": "Swayambhunath is an ancient religious complex atop a hill in the Kathmandu Valley, west of Kathmandu city. It is also known as the Monkey Temple as there are holy monkeys living in the north-west parts of the temple. The Tibetan name for the site means 'Sublime Trees' for the many varieties of trees found on the hill. Swayambhunath is the major pilgrimage site for Buddhist Newars and second most important place after Boudhanath for Tibetan Buddhists. Swayambhunath, is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal. According to the Gopālarājavaṃśāvalī Swayambhunath was founded by the great-grandfather of King Mānadeva (464 -505 CE), King Vṛsadeva , about the beginning of the 5th century CE. This seems to be confirmed by a damaged stone inscription found at the site, which indicates that King Mānadeva ordered work done in 640 CE. The stupa was completely renovated in May 2010, its first major renovation since 1921 and its 15th in the nearly 1,500 years since it was built. However, the stupa faced many damages in the earthquake 2015.",
