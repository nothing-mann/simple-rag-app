  "description": "Patan is considered as the oldest among the three cities of Kathmandu Valley. There are very few historical materials that shed light on the antiquity of Patan. Some chronicles even mention the King from India known as Asoka’s visit to Kathmandu in 250 BC and the erection of five Asoka Stupas, a dome-shaped structure erected as a Buddhist shrine. There is unanimity among the scholars that Patan was a well-established and developed town since ancient times. During the Lichhavi period, the place was known as Yupa Grama. There is a mention of the abolition of tax from Yupa Grama during the reign of King Narendra Dev (643-678 AD) in an inscription executed in 643 AD. In the course of time, Yupa Grama was changed into Patan and Lalitpur. The place was developed as the center of art, architecture, and culture and known as the City of Fine Arts. The palace complex is located at the center of the city. There is even lesser amount of the historical accounts on Durbar Square before the sixteenth century in comparison to the city as a whole. All the artworks and architectural buildings around the Durbar Square are from the sixteenth century and onwards. The Manga tap and inscriptions inside the Keshav Narayan courtyard are the strongest evidences of its historical city and antiquity. But there is a hint of the existence of the Royal Palace even before the sixteenth century. Some chronicles mention that during the eleventh century, a Thakuri King Vara Deva by name did not like to reside in the Durbar located in a place called Madhyalakhu that was left vacant by his father after renouncing the world and started to live at the palace in Maningala Palace of Patan, which was constructed by his grandfather. Similarly, some accounts mention about the construction of a courtyard within the palace complex in 1167 AD by King Rudra Deva. Patan Durbar Square constitutes the most spectacular example of Malla architecture within any urban context in the Kathmandu Valley. The palace of the Malla Kings that were constructed in three major sections from 1668 to 1734 separates the green spaces of the palace gardens on the east from the extraordinary public square on the west. The public square contains four major-storied temples, two stone Sikhara style temples, a huge freestanding bell, several stone platforms, pillars, and smaller shrines. The earliest temple is the Char Narayan, a two-storied temple built in 1565. Altogether there are nineteen individual structures of importance. The palace embellishes with numerous courtyards, royal buildings, art and architectural monuments, and the religious temples in different styles. All those historical monuments in collective are called the Patan Durbar Square. It was not only a royal seat but the center of administration also. All the monuments and buildings were the creations of hundreds of years and the contribution of thousands of people during the reign of various kings. There are the concentrations of the monuments mostly made during the reign of King SiddhinaraSingha Malla. This palace complex comprised more than thirty monuments. Another attraction of this Durbar Square is the retaining of its original look in comparison to the other two Durbar Squares of the Kathmandu Valley. King SiddhinaraSingha Malla, who ascended the throne in 1618 A.D., had embellished the palatial complex and expanded it. He constructed a small temple for his tutelary deity, the Taleju. In 1646 A.D., he dug the pond of Bhandarkhal and constructed a stone spout for the royal use only. He consecrated the Degutale Temple of Patan, but could not stand for long due to the destruction by fire. Similarly, the most beautiful and famous courtyard of the Patan Durbar known as Sundari courtyard was also his contribution. The courtyard is further decorated with a waterspout called Tusahiti that is famous for its collection of intricately carved stone icons of different Gods and Goddesses. Being the residential buildings of the kings, the courtyard is more important and equally famous as well. The building is made in three storied and fully decorated with intricate woodcarvings. In addition to all these contributions, King SiddhinaraSingha Malla’s another greatest contribution is Krishna Temple that is made of stone. It was inaugurated in 1636 A.D. the temple is in Sikhara style and has twenty-one pinnacles which is another greatest attraction of the Patan Durbar Square. In this way, King SiddhinaraSingha Malla made a grand Palace and made it more attractive. After SiddhinaraSingha Malla, his son Shreenivas Malla ascended the throne of Patan. He had also a great contribution in developing the Patan Durbar Square. First of all, he completed the construction of Mul courtyard that was started by his father and enlarged the temple of Taleju that was also made by his father in smaller scale. The temple of Degutale built by his father was damaged by fire ten years after its completion and Shreenivas Malla restored it to its original size and also the temple of God Bhimsen was built by him. In this way, he enlarged the Durbar Square and embellished it with more temples and courtyards. In addition to that, there are a lot of his artworks and architectural buildings scattered in Patan and nearby places such as Pharping, Bungamati, and Kritipur. A manuscript of 1663 A.D. mentions about a large scale firing in Patan area that destroyed most of the monuments but he renovated all of them very immediately. There was some sort of competition among the contemporary kings of Kathmandu Valley in building, enlarging, and decorating their royal complexes, King Pratap Malla in Kantipur, King Jagat Prakash Malla, Jitamitra Malla, and King Bhupatindra Malla of Bhaktapur and SiddhinaraSingha Malla, King Shreenivas Malla, and King Yognarendra Malla of Patan were the good competitors. Shreenivas Malla was succeeded by his son Yognarendra Malla in 1684 A.D. his creations, we see at present, are Manimandap and his own statue with his family members on the capital of a stone pillar. The northernmost courtyard; known as Keshav Narayan courtyard is his most important and famous addition to the Durbar. It is one of the oldest courtyards of the palace complex and was famous with the name Chaukwath Palace. In almost all the historical documents, there is mention of Chaukwath Palace that means a palace having four towers in four cardinal directions. Local people believe that before the construction of Chaukwath Palace, a monastery called Ratnakara Mahavihar occupied the site. It was removed to another part of the town and Chaukwath Palace was erected in place of it. The construction of the palace was initiated during the time of King Laxmi Kamadeva (1024-1040 A.D.). Artistic four-storied buildings on all the four sides surround the courtyard. Historians are of the opinion that this part of the Durbar was erected in order to shelter the army and security officers in medieval time. The building was further renovated and decorated by King Vishnu Malla in 1733 A.D. Patan Palace square has got three main courtyards at the moment but during the medieval time, there were even more. The name of the other courtyards, as we know from the literature, were Nhuchhe courtyard, Agam courtyard, Kisi courtyard, Sahapu courtyard, Nasal courtyard, Dafoswan courtyard, Kumari courtyard, and so on. But there is no account left on those courtyards about who and when they were constructed. There are still some parts left, made by King SiddhinaraSingha Malla and Shreenivas Malla. All the historical buildings, and the religious temples erected during a long span of time by different kings are the main attraction of the Durbar Square today. The monuments, sculptures, and art objects in and around Durbar Square are considered as examples of excellence on architectural designs and artistic expressions. Government of Nepal has declared it a Protected Monument Zone and the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO inscribed it into the world heritage list as a part of Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site in the year 1979.",
