  "description": "Maṅgaḥ Hiti was built by Bhāravi (King Manadeva’s daughter’s son) in 570 CE. It is still being used by the local community for day-to-day activities and religious purposes. Maṅgaḥ Hiti is one of the most significant monuments in the Patan Darbar Square. It is located adjacent to the former royal palace complex, and was further developed as a part it in the later period.\n\nThe three water spouts of the Maṅgaḥ Hiti are intricately carved, depicting both mythical and real creatures. The creatures are expertly carved in an overlapping and layered manner. The fine craftsmanship is particularly prominent in the sophisticated design of the middle spout.  The first creature that adorns the elongated spout is the mythical Makara with a wide-open mouth.  Second, a water buffalo, depicted with a coiled mustache, protrudes from Makara's mouth. At last, a fish, similarly carved with a wide-open mouth, protrudes from the buffalo's mouth, forming the mouth of the spout.  Garuḍa’s head forms the uppermost part of the spout and its wings are on the sides, behind the Makara image. There is also a depiction of merpeople behind the Garuḍa’s feet. The other two spouts have similar iconographic programs.\n\nThere is a niche (gavākṣa) with a stone toraṇa crowning the middle spout where a statue of Sukhāvatī Lokeśvara is installed. The two side spouts also have similar niches, however, the statues once adorned them are long gone.  Images of Bhagīratha are carved below each spout. The local community refers to the central spout as Hi Hiti, the one to the right as Duru Hiti, and the one to the left as Vāsa Hiti (R. Jośī VS 2065, 12-13). A jaḥdhuṃhiti in the Hiti premises bears an inscription 'om samvat māta’ (D. Vajrācārya VS 2030, 596-597). There is a stone filter in front of the spout, which was probably used to regulate the water flow.\n\nMaṅgaḥ Hiti holds the oldest inscription found in the premises of the Square, recording the construction of the Hiti in the Licchavi Period, in 570 CE, by Bhāravi (son of King Mānadeva’s daughter) (D. Vajrācārya VS 2030, 208). Bhāravi constructed a hiti in Hadigaun as well (D. Vajrācārya VS 2030, 208). The Hiti was further extended and adorned as a part of the royal palace complex in the medieval period. The astonishingly carved mouths of the spouts date to this period. The style of the Hiti’s Makara motifs belongs to the late medieval period, and differ from the motifs of the Licchavi Period, signalling that they were reconstructed in a later period (S. Parājulī VS 2068, 157).\n\nAnother inscription dating 1958 CE (VS 2015) records that King Mahendra renovated the Hiti complex including its boundary walls. Similar to other hitis in the Valley, the water flow in this Hiti too increases during the monsoon and decreases during the winter months. The Hiti is being uninterruptedly used since the Licchavi Period. The local community still relies on this traditional water system for their day-to-day activities. Water collected from the Maṅga Hiti is still used during the Narasiṃha dance, one of the most popular parts of the annual Kārtika Nāca (dance) event initiated by King Siddhinarasiṃha Malla (1619–1661) as part of his religious policy of spreading Kṛṣṇaism in the Kathmandu Valley.",
