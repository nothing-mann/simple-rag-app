  "description": "Swayambhunath is an ancient religious architecture situated atop a hill in the Kathmandu Valley. According to Swayambhu Purana, the entire valley was an enormous lake out of which a lotus emerged, leading to the valley being known as Swayambhu, meaning self-created. It is probably the most sacred among Buddhist pilgrimage sites and is also revered by Hindus. The complex consists of a stupa, shrines, and temples, some dating back to the Licchavi period. The stupa has Buddha's eyes and eyebrows painted on, looking in all four directions. It was founded by King Rupa Deva about the beginning of the fifth century CE. A damaged stone inscription at the site indicates work done in 640 CE. However, it is said that the temple was developed on the hill by Emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE, which was later destroyed. Circling the stupa, devotees pay worship by spending the previous. The monkeys at the site are considered holy as they are the head lice of Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of wisdom and learning. Devotees give food to the monkeys. The Swayambhunath complex suffered damage in the April 2015 earthquake. The stupa was renovated in 2010, and the dome was regilded using 20 kilograms of gold. The area consists of shops that sell varieties of Nepali traditional artifacts and souvenirs. Swayambhunath is also a famous viewpoint of the Kathmandu Valley."
