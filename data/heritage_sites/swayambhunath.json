    "description": "Swayambhunath is an ancient religious architecture situated atop a hill in the valley. According to Swayambhu Purana, the entire valley was an enormous lake out of which the valley came to be known as Swayambhu, meaning self-created. It is probably the most sacred among Buddhist pilgrimage sites and also revered by Hindus. The complex consists of a stupa, shrines, and temples, some dating back to the Licchavi period. The stupa has Buddha's eyes and eyebrows painted on, looking in all four directions.",
