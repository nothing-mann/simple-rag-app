  "description": "The 8-meter-tall stone pillar supports statues of King Yoganarendra Malla (r. 1685-1705) and his two wives. Similar pillars exist at the Darbar squares in Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. The king is depicted seated on a lotus, his hands folded in the añjali gesture. He is clad in elegant clothes, wears a Newar hat and carries a sword and a shield on his left side. A cobra (nāga) rises protectively behind him, with a small bird perched atop the cobra’s head. The queen on his left is also protected by a five-headed nāga. The pillar and statues were restored by a team from the University of Applied Arts, Vienna in 2016-17 (Krist 2017).",
